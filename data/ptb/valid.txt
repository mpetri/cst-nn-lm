consumers may want to move their telephones a little closer to the tv set
couch-potato jocks watching abc 's monday night football can now vote during halftime for the greatest play in 20 years from among four or five filmed replays
two weeks ago viewers of several nbc daytime consumer segments started calling a 900 number for advice on various life-style issues
and the new syndicated reality show hard copy records viewers ' opinions for possible airing on the next day 's show
interactive telephone technology has taken a new leap in sophistication and television programmers are racing to exploit the possibilities
eventually viewers may grow bored with the technology and resent the cost
but right now programmers are figuring that viewers who are busy dialing up a range of services may put down their remote control zappers and stay tuned
we 've been spending a lot of time in los angeles talking to tv production people says mike parks president of call interactive which supplied technology for both abc sports and nbc 's consumer minutes
with the competitiveness of the television market these days everyone is looking for a way to get viewers more excited
one of the leaders behind the expanded use of 900 numbers is call interactive a joint venture of giants american express co. and american telephone & telegraph co
formed in august the venture weds at&t 's newly expanded 900 service with 200 voice-activated computers in american express 's omaha neb. service center
other long-distance carriers have also begun marketing enhanced 900 service and special consultants are springing up to exploit the new tool
blair entertainment a new york firm that advises tv stations and sells ads for them has just formed a subsidiary 900 blair to apply the technology to television
the use of 900 toll numbers has been expanding rapidly in recent years
for a while high-cost pornography lines and services that tempt children to dial and redial movie or music information earned the service a somewhat sleazy image but new legal restrictions are aimed at trimming excesses
the cost of a 900 call is set by the originator abc sports for example with the cheapest starting at 75 cents
billing is included in a caller 's regular phone bill
from the fee the local phone company and the long-distance carrier extract their costs to carry the call passing the rest of the money to the originator which must cover advertising and other costs
in recent months the technology has become more flexible and able to handle much more volume
before callers of 900 numbers would just listen and not talk or they 'd vote yes or no by calling one of two numbers
people in the phone business call this technology 900 click
now callers are led through complex menus of choices to retrieve information they want and the hardware can process 10,000 calls in 90 seconds
up to now 900 numbers have mainly been used on local tv stations and cable channels
mtv used one to give away the house that rock star jon bon jovi grew up in
for several years turner broadcasting system 's cable news network has invited viewers to respond nightly to topical issues should the u.s. military intervene in panama but even the hottest controversies on cnn log only about 10,000 calls
the newest uses of the 900-interactive technology demonstrate the growing variety of applications
capital cities/abc inc. cbs inc. and general electric co. 's national broadcasting co. unit are expected to announce soon a joint campaign to raise awareness about hunger
the subject will be written into the plots of prime-time shows and viewers will be given a 900 number to call
callers will be sent educational booklets and the call 's modest cost will be an immediate method of raising money
other network applications have very different goals
abc sports was looking for ways to lift deflated halftime ratings for monday night football
kurt sanger abc sports 's marketing director says that now tens of thousands of fans call its 900 number each week to vote for the best punt return quarterback sack etc
profit from the calls goes to charity but abc sports also uses the calls as a sales tool after thanking callers for voting frank gifford offers a football videotape for $ 19.95 and 5 % of callers stay on the line to order it
jackets may be sold next
meanwhile nbc sports recently began scores plus a year-round 24-hour 900 line providing a complex array of scores analysis and fan news
a spokesman said its purpose is to bolster the impression that nbc sports is always there for people
nbc 's on-line consumer minutes have increased advertiser spending during the day the network 's weakest period
each weekday matches a sponsor and a topic on mondays unilever n.v. 's lever bros. sponsors tips on diet and exercise followed by a 30-second lever bros. commercial
viewers can call a 900 number for additional advice which will be tailored to their needs based on the numbers they punch press one if you 're pregnant etc
if the caller stays on the line and leaves a name and address for the sponsor coupons and a newsletter will be mailed and the sponsor will be able to gather a list of desirable potential customers
diane seaman an nbc-tv vice president says nbc has been able to charge premium rates for this ad time
she would n't say what the premium is but it 's believed to be about 40 % above regular daytime rates
we were able to get advertisers to use their promotion budget for this because they get a chance to do couponing says ms. seaman
and we were able to attract some new advertisers because this is something new
mr. parks of call interactive says tv executives are considering the use of 900 numbers for talk shows game shows news and opinion surveys
experts are predicting a big influx of new shows in 1990 when a service called automatic number information will become widely available
this service identifies each caller 's phone number and it can be used to generate instant mailing lists
hard copy the new syndicated tabloid show from paramount pictures will use its 900 number for additional purposes that include research says executive producer mark b. von s. monsky
for a piece on local heroes of world war ii we can ask people to leave the name and number of anyone they know who won a medal he says
that 'll save us time and get people involved
but mr. monsky sees much bigger changes ahead
these are just baby steps toward real interactive video which i believe will be the biggest thing yet to affect television he says
although it would be costly to shoot multiple versions tv programmers could let audiences vote on different endings for a movie
fox broadcasting experimented with this concept last year when viewers of married with children voted on whether al should say i love you to peg on valentine 's day
someday viewers may also choose different depths of news coverage
a menu by phone could let you decide i 'm interested in just the beginning of story no. 1 and i want story no. 2 in depth mr. monsky says
you 'll start to see shows where viewers program the program
integrated resources inc. the troubled financial-services company that has been trying to sell its core companies to restructure debt said talks with a potential buyer ended
integrated did n't identify the party or say why the talks failed
last week another potential buyer whitehall financial group which had agreed in august to purchase most of integrated 's core companies for $ 310 million ended talks with integrated
integrated said that it would continue to pursue other alternatives to sell the five core companies and that a group of senior executives plans to make a proposal to purchase three of the companies integrated resources equity corp. resources trust co. and integrated resources asset management corp
a price was n't disclosed
integrated also said it expects to report a second-quarter loss wider than the earlier estimate of about $ 600 million
the company did n't disclose the new estimate but said the change was related to integrated 's failure to sell its core businesses as well as other events which it did n't detail that occurred after its announcement last week that it was in talks with the unidentified prospective buyer
meanwhile a number of top sales producers from integrated resources equity will meet this afternoon in chicago to discuss their options
the unit is a loosely constructed group of about 3,900 independent brokers and financial planners who sell insurance annuities limited partnerships mutual funds and other investments for integrated and other firms
the sales force is viewed as a critical asset in integrated 's attempt to sell its core companies
whitehall cited concerns about how long integrated would be able to hold together the sales force as one reason its talks with integrated failed
in composite trading on the new york stock exchange yesterday integrated closed at $ 1.25 a share down 25 cents
integrated has been struggling to avoid a bankruptcy-law filing since june when it failed to make interest payments on nearly $ 1 billion of debt

alpine group inc. revised its exchange offer for $ 43.7 million face amount of 13.5 % senior subordinated debt due 1996 and extended the offer to oct. 27 from oct. 12
the hackensack n.j. company said holders would receive for each $ 1,000 face amount $ 750 face amount of a new issue of secured senior subordinated notes convertible into common stock at an initial rate of $ 6.50 a share and 50 common shares
the new notes will bear interest at 5.5 % through july 31 1991 and thereafter at 10 %
under the original proposal the maker of specialty coatings and a developer of information-display technologies offered $ 400 of notes due 1996 10 common shares and $ 175 in cash for each $ 1,000 face amount
completion of the exchange offer is subject to the tender of at least 80 % of the debt among other things
alpine which said it does n't plan to further extend the offer said it received $ 615,000 face amount of debt under the original offer
the stock of ual corp. continued to be pounded amid signs that british airways may balk at any hasty reformulation of the aborted $ 6.79 billion buy-out of united airlines ' parent
ual stock plummeted a further $ 24.875 to $ 198 on volume of more than 2.8 million shares in new york stock exchange composite trading
the plunge followed a drop of $ 56.875 monday amid indications the takeover may take weeks to be revived
the stock has fallen $ 87.25 or 31 % in the three trading days since announcement of the collapse of the $ 300-a-share takeover jolted the entire stock market into its second-worst plunge ever
this is a total bloodbath for takeover-stock traders one investment banker said
los angeles financier marvin davis who put united in play with a $ 5.4 billion bid two months ago last night proffered both a ray of hope and an extra element of uncertainty by saying he remains interested in acquiring ual
but he dropped his earlier $ 300-a-share back-up bid saying he must first explore bank financing
even as citicorp and chase manhattan corp. scrambled to line up bank financing for a revised version of the lapsed labor-management bid british airways a 15 % partner in the buying group indicated it wants to start from scratch
its partners are united 's pilots who were to own 75 % and ual management at 10 %
adding insult to injury united 's 25,000-member machinists ' union which helped scuttle financing for the first bid yesterday asked ual chairman stephen wolf and other ual directors to resign
a similar demand was made by a group that represents some of united 's 26,000 noncontract employees
john peterpaul machinists union general vice president attacked mr. wolf as greedy and irresponsible for pursuing the buy-out
although mr. wolf and john pope ual 's chief financial officer stood to pocket $ 114.3 million for stock and options in the buy-out ual executives planned to reinvest only $ 15 million in the new company
the blue-collar machinists longtime rivals of the white-collar pilots say the buyout would load the company with debt and weaken its finances
confusion about the two banks ' hurried efforts to round up financing for a new bid that the ual board has n't even seen yet helped send ual stock spiraling downward
and rumors of forced selling by takeover-stock traders triggered a 25-point downdraft in the dow jones industrial average around 11:15 a.m. edt yesterday
yesterday 's selling began after a japanese news agency reported that japanese banks which balked at the first bid were ready to reject a revised version at around $ 250 a share or $ 5.65 billion
several reports as the day progressed gave vague or conflicting indications about whether banks would sign up
citicorp for example said only that it had expressions of interest of a transaction from both the borrowers and the banks but did n't have an agreement
late in the day mr. wolf issued a onepage statement calling mr. peterpaul 's blast divisive and uncalled for
but he gave few details on the progress toward a new bid saying only we are working toward a revised proposal for majority employee ownership
meanwhile in another sign that a new bid is n't imminent it was learned that the ual board held a telephone meeting monday to hear an update on the situation but that a formal board meeting is n't likely to be convened until early next week
in london british airways chairman lord king was quoted in the times as declaring he is not prepared to take my shareholders into a hasty deal
observers said it appeared that british air was angered at the way the bid has degenerated into confusion as well as by the banks ' effort to round up financing for what one called a deal that is n't a deal
the effort to revive the bid was complicated by the unwieldy nature of the three-party buying group
the pilots were meeting outside chicago yesterday
but british air which was to have supplied $ 750 million out of $ 965 million in equity financing apparently was n't involved in the second proposal and could well reject it even if banks obtain financing
a group of united 's noncontract employees said in a statement the fact that wolf and other officers were going to line their pockets with literally millions of dollars while instituting severe pay cuts on the nonunion employees of united is not only deplorable but inexcusable
the machinists also asked for an investigation by the securities and exchange commission into possible securities-law violations in the original bid for ual by mr. davis as well as in the response by ual
last week just before the bank commitments were due the union asked the u.s. labor department to study whether the bid violated legal standards of fairness governing employee investment funds
in his statement mr. wolf said we continue to believe our approach is sound and that it is far better for all employees than the alternative of having an outsider own the company with employees paying for it just the same
mr. wolf has eschewed merger advice from a major wall street securities firm relying instead only on a takeover lawyer peter atkins of skadden arps slate meagher & flom
the huge drop in ual stock prompted one takeover stock trader george kellner managing partner of kellner dileo & co. to deny publicly rumors that his firm was going out of business
mr. kellner said that despite losses on ual stock his firm 's health is excellent
the stock 's decline also has left the ual board in a quandary
although it may not be legally obligated to sell the company if the buy-out group ca n't revive its bid it may have to explore alternatives if the buyers come back with a bid much lower than the group 's original $ 300-a-share proposal
at a meeting sept. 1 to consider the labor-management bid the board also was informed by its investment adviser first boston corp. of interest expressed by buy-out funds including kohlberg kravis roberts & co. and forstmann little & co. as well as by robert bass morgan stanley 's buy-out fund and pan am corp
the takeover-stock traders were hoping that mr. davis or one of the other interested parties might re-emerge with the situation in disarray or that the board might consider a recapitalization
meanwhile japanese bankers said they were still hesitant about accepting citicorp 's latest proposal
macmillan inc. said it plans a public offering of 8.4 million shares of its berlitz international inc. unit at $ 19 to $ 21 a share
the offering for the language school unit was announced by robert maxwell chairman and chief executive officer of london-based maxwell communication corp. which owns macmillan
after the offering is completed macmillan will own about 56 % of the berlitz common stock outstanding
five million shares will be offered in the u.s. and 3.4 million additional shares will be offered in concurrent international offerings outside the u.s
goldman sachs & co. will manage the offering
macmillan said berlitz intends to pay quarterly dividends on the stock
the company said it expects to pay the first dividend of 12.5 cents a share in the 1990 first quarter
berlitz will borrow an amount equal to its expected net proceeds from the offerings plus $ 50 million in connection with a credit agreement with lenders
the total borrowing will be about $ 208 million the company said
proceeds from the borrowings under the credit agreement will be used to pay an $ 80 million cash dividend to macmillan and to lend the remainder of about $ 128 million to maxwell communications in connection with a promissory note
proceeds from the offering will be used to repay borrowings under the short-term parts of a credit agreement
berlitz which is based in princeton n.j. provides language instruction and translation services through more than 260 language centers in 25 countries
in the past five years more than 68 % of its sales have been outside the u.s
macmillan has owned berlitz since 1966
in the first six months of this year berlitz posted net income of $ 7.6 million on sales of $ 106.2 million compared with net income of $ 8.2 million on sales of $ 90.6 million
right away you notice the following things about a philip glass concert
it attracts people with funny hair or with no hair in front of me a girl with spiked locks sat beside a boy who had shaved his
whoever constitute the local left bank come out in force dressed in black along with a smattering of yuppies who want to be on the cutting edge
people in glass houses tend to look stoned
and if still conscious at the evening 's end you notice something else the audience at first entranced and hypnotized by the music releases its pent-up feelings in collective gratitude
currently in the middle of a four-week 20-city tour as a solo pianist mr. glass has left behind his synthesizers equipment and collaborators in favor of going it alone
he sits down at the piano and plays
and plays
either one likes it or one does n't
the typical glass audience which is more likely to be composed of music students than their teachers certainly does
the work though sounds like muzak for spaceships
philip glass is the emperor and his music the new clothes of the avant-garde
his success is easy to understand
softly introducing and explaining his pieces mr. glass looks and sounds more like a shaggy poet describing his work than a classical pianist playing a recital
the piano compositions which have been labeled variously as minimalist oriental repetitive cyclical monophonic and hypnotic are relentlessly tonal therefore unthreatening unvaryingly rhythmic therefore soporific and unflaggingly harmonious but unmelodic therefore both pretty and unconventional
it is music for people who want to hear something different but do n't want to work especially hard at the task
it is e-z listening for the now generation
mr. glass has inverted the famous modernist dictum less is more
his more is always less
far from being minimalist the music unabatingly torments us with apparent novelties not so cleverly disguised in the simplicities of 4/4 time octave intervals and ragtime or gospel chord progressions
but the music has its charm and mr. glass has constructed his solo program around a move from the simple to the relatively complex
opening 1981 from glassworks introduces the audience to the glass technique never straying too far from the piano 's center mr. glass works in the two octaves on either side of middle c and his fingers seldom leave the keys
there is a recognizable musical style here but not a particular performance style
the music is not especially pianistic indeed it 's hard to imagine a bad performance of it
nothing bravura no arpeggios no ticklish fingering problems challenge the performer
we hear we may think inner voices but they all seem to be saying the same thing
with planet news music meant to accompany readings of allen ginsberg 's wichita vortex sutra mr. glass gets going
his hands sit farther apart on the keyboard
seventh chords make you feel as though he may break into a very slow improvisatory riff
the chords modulate but there is little filigree even though his fingers begin to wander over more of the keys
contrasts predictably accumulate first the music is loud then it becomes soft then you realize it becomes louder again
the fourth knee play an interlude from einstein on the beach is like a toccata but it does n't seem to move much beyond its left-hand ground in three blind mice
when mr. glass decides to get really fancy he crosses his hands and hits a resonant bass note with his right hand
he does this in at least three of his solo pieces
you might call it a leitmotif or a virtuoso accomplishment
in mad rush which came from a commission to write a piece of indeterminate length mr. glass charmingly and tellingly confessed that this was no problem for me an a section alternates with a b section several times before the piece ends unresolved
not only is the typical glasswork open-ended it is also often multiple in its context s
mad rush began its life as the accompaniment to the dalai lama 's first public address in the u.s. when mr. glass played it on the organ at new york 's cathedral of st. john the divine
later it was performed on radio bremen in germany and then lucinda childs took it for one of her dance pieces
the point is that any piece can be used as background music for virtually anything
the evening ended with mr. glass 's metamorphosis another multiple work
parts 1 2 and 5 come from the soundtrack of errol morris 's acclaimed film the thin blue line and the two other parts from incidental music to two separate dramatizations of the kafka story of the same name
when used as background in this way the music has an appropriate eeriness as when a two-note phrase a descending minor third accompanies the seemingly endless litany of reports interviews and confessions of witnesses in the morris film
served up as a solo however the music lacks the resonance provided by a context within another medium
admirers of mr. glass may agree with the critic richard kostelanetz 's sense that the 1974 music in twelve parts is as encyclopedic and weighty as the well-tempered clavier
but while making the obvious point that both composers develop variations from themes this comparison ignores the intensely claustrophobic nature of mr. glass 's music
its supposedly austere minimalism overlays a bombast that makes one yearn for the astringency of neoclassical stravinsky the genuinely radical minimalism of berg and webern and what in retrospect even seems like concision in mahler
mr. spiegelman is professor of english at southern methodist university and editor of the southwest review
honeywell inc. said it hopes to complete shortly the first of two sales of shares in its japanese joint venture yamatake-honeywell for about $ 280 million
the company would n't disclose the buyer of the initial 16 % stake
proceeds of the sale expected to be completed next week would be used to repurchase as many as 10 million shares of honeywell stock the company said
honeywell said it is negotiating the sale of a second stake in yamatake-honeywell but indicated it intends to hold at least 20 % of the joint venture 's stock long term
a 20 % stake would allow honeywell to include yamatake earnings in its results
honeywell previously said it intended to reduce its holding in the japanese concern as part of a restructuring plan which also calls for a reduction of dependence on weapons sales
yesterday a spokeswoman said the company was pleased with our progress in that regard and hopes to provide additional details soon
honeywell said its defense and marine systems group incurred delays in shipping some undisclosed contracts during the third quarter resulting in lower operating profit for that business
overall honeywell reported earnings of $ 74.4 million or $ 1.73 a share for the three months ended oct. 1 compared with a loss of $ 41.4 million or 98 cents a share a year earlier
the previous period 's results included a $ 108 million pretax charge related to unrecoverable contract costs and a $ 12.3 million pretax gain on real estate sales
sales for the latest quarter were flat at $ 1.72 billion
for the nine months honeywell reported earnings of $ 212.1 million or $ 4.92 a share compared with earnings of $ 47.9 million or $ 1.13 a share a year earlier
sales declined slightly to $ 5.17 billion
once again your editorial page misstates the law to conform to your almost beatific misperceptions
in an excursus of little relevance to his central point about private enforcement suits by environmental groups michael s. greve informs your readers the clean water act is written upon the presumption the pretense rather that nothing but zero risk will do it establishes a legal standard of zero discharge congress's environmental buccaneers sept. 18
this statement surely buttresses your editorial viewpoint that environmental protection is generally silly or excessive but it is simply wrong
the clean water act contains no legal standard of zero discharge
it requires that discharges of pollutants into the waters of the united states be authorized by permits that reflect the effluent limitations developed under section 301
whatever may be the problems with this system it scarcely reflects zero risk or zero discharge
perhaps mr. greve was confused by congress 's meaningless statement of the national goal in section 101 which indeed calls for the elimination of discharges by 1985 no less
this fatuous statement was not taken seriously when enacted in 1972 and should not now be confused with the operative provisions of the statute
thus you do the public a great disservice when mr. greve suggests even facetiously that the clean water act prohibits the preparation of a scotch and water your tippling readers may be led to believe that nothing but chance or oversight protects them as they cower in the night with their scotch and waters from the hairyknuckled knock of the sierra club at their doors

national geographic the sixth-largest u.s. magazine is attracting more readers than ever and offers the glossy high-toned pages that upscale advertisers love
so why did advertising pages plunge by almost 10 % and ad revenue by 7.2 % in the first half
to hear advertisers tell it the magazine just has n't kept up with the times
despite renewed interest by the public in such topics as the environment and the third world it has n't been able to shake its reputation as a magazine boys like to flip through in search of topless tribe women
worse it lagged behind competitors in offering now-standard gimmicks from regional editions to discounts for frequent advertisers
but now the magazine is attempting to fight back with an ambitious plan including a revamped sales strategy and a surprisingly aggressive ad campaign
advertisers do n't think of the magazine first says joan mccraw who joined in april as national advertising director
what we want to do is take a more aggressive stance
people did n't believe we were in tune with the marketplace and in many ways we were n't
the 101-year-old magazine has never had to woo advertisers with quite so much fervor before
it largely rested on its hard-to-fault demographics 10.8 million subscribers in the first half up from 10.5 million a year ago an average age of 42 for readers at the height of their consuming years loyalty to the tune of an 85 % average subscription renewal rate
the magazine had its best year yet in 1988 when it celebrated its centennial and racked up a 17 % gain in ad pages to 283
but this year when the hullabaloo surrounding its centennial died so too did some advertiser interest
the reason ad executives say is that the entire magazine business has been soft and national geographic has some quirks that make it especially unattractive during a soft market
perhaps the biggest of those factors is its high ad prices $ 130,000 for a four-color page vs. $ 47,000 for the smithsonian a comparable publication with a far smaller circulation
when ad dollars are tight the high page cost is a major deterrent for advertisers who generally want to appear regularly in a publication or not at all
even though national geographic offers far more readers than does a magazine like smithsonian the page costs you an arm and a leg to develop any frequency says harry glass new york media manager for bozell inc
to combat that problem national geographic like other magazines began offering regional editions allowing advertisers to appear in only a portion of its magazines for example ads can run only in the magazines sent to subscribers in the largest 25 markets
but the magazine was slower than its competitors to come up with its regional editions and until last year offered fewer of them than did competitors
time magazine for example has more than 100 separate editions going to different regions top management and other groups
another sticking point for advertisers was national geographic 's tradition of lumping its ads together usually at the beginning or end of the magazine rather than spreading ads out among its articles as most magazines do
and national geographic 's smaller-than-average size means extra production costs for advertisers
but ms. mccraw says the magazine is fighting back
it now offers 30 regional editions it very recently began running ads adjacent to articles and it has been beefing up its sales force
and it just launched a promotional campaign to tell chief executives marketing directors and media executives just that
the centerpiece of the promotion is its new ad campaign into which the magazine will pour about $ 500,000 mostly in the next few weeks
the campaign created by omnicom group 's ddb needham agency takes advantage of the eye-catching photography that national geographic is known for
in one ad a photo of the interior of the sainte-chapelle in paris is paired with the headline the only book more respected than ours does n't accept advertising
another ad pictures a tree ant magnified 80 times with the headline for impact far beyond your size consider our regional editions
ms. mccraw says she wants the campaign to help attract advertisers in 10 categories including corporate financial services consumer electronics insurance and food
her goal to top 300 ad pages in 1990 up from about 274 this year
whether she can meet that ambitious goal is still far from certain
the ad campaign is meant to contemporize the thought of national geographic she says
we want it to be a '90s kind of image
wcrs plans ad-unit sale

the commodity futures trading commission plans to restrict dual trading on commodity exchanges a move almost certain to infuriate exchange officials and traders
the cftc said it will propose the restrictions after the release of a study that shows little economic benefit resulting from dual trading and cites problems associated with the practice
dual trading gives an exchange trader the right to trade both for his own account and for customers
the issue exploded this year after a federal bureau of investigation operation led to charges of widespread trading abuses at the chicago board of trade and chicago mercantile exchange
while not specifically mentioned in the fbi charges dual trading became a focus of attempts to tighten industry regulations
critics contend that traders were putting buying or selling for their own accounts ahead of other traders ' customer orders
traders are likely to oppose such restrictions because dual trading provides a way to make money in slower markets where there is a shortage of customer orders
the exchanges contend that dual trading improves liquidity in the markets because traders can buy or sell even when they do n't have a customer order in hand
the exchanges say liquidity becomes a severe problem for thinly traded contracts such as those with a long time remaining before expiration
the cftc may take those arguments into account by allowing exceptions to its restrictions
the agency did n't cite specific situations where dual trading might be allowed but smaller exchanges or contracts that need additional liquidity are expected to be among them
wendy gramm the agency 's chairman told the senate agriculture committee that she expects the study to be released within two weeks and the rule changes to be completed by thanksgiving
the study by the cftc 's division of economic analysis shows that a trade is a trade a member of the study team said
whether a trade is done on a dual or non-dual basis the member said does n't seem to have much economic impact
currently most traders on commodity exchanges specialize in trading either for customer accounts which makes them brokers or for their own accounts as socalled locals
the tests indicate that dual and non-dual traders are similar in terms of the trade executions and liquidity they provide to the market mrs. gramm told the senate panel
members of congress have proposed restricting dual trading in bills to reauthorize cftc operations
the house 's bill would prohibit dual trading in markets with daily average volume of 7,000 contracts or more comprising those considered too difficult to track without a sophisticated computer system
the senate bill would force the cftc to suspend dual trading if an exchange ca n't show that its oversight system can detect dual-trading abuses
so far one test of restricting dual trading has worked well
the chicago merc banned dual trading in its standard & poor 's 500-stock index futures pit in 1987
under the rules traders decide before a session begins whether they will trade for their own account or for customers
traders who stand on the pit 's top step where most customer orders are executed ca n't trade for themselves
a merc spokesman said the plan has n't made much difference in liquidity in the pit
it 's too soon to tell but people do n't seem to be unhappy with it he said
he said he would n't comment on the cftc plan until the exchange has seen the full proposal
but at a meeting last week tom donovan the board of trade 's president told commodity lawyers dual trading is definitely worth saving
it adds something to the market
japanese firms push posh car showrooms
japanese luxury-car makers are trying to set strict design standards for their dealerships
but some dealers are negotiating looser terms while others decline to deal at all
nissan motor co. 's infiniti division likes to insist that every dealer construct and furnish a building in a japanese style
specifications include a polished bronze sculpture at the center of each showroom and a tile bridge spanning a stream that flows into the building from outside
infiniti has it down to the ashtrays says jay ferron a partner at j.d. power & associates an auto research firm
toyota motor corp. 's lexus division also provides specifications
but only two-thirds of lexus dealers are constructing new buildings according to the lexus specs
some are even coming up with their own novel designs
in louisville ky. for example david peterson has built a lexus dealership with the showroom on the second floor
yet some dealers have turned down infiniti or lexus franchises because they were unwilling or unable to meet the design requirements
lee seidman of cleveland says infiniti was a bear on interiors but at least let him retrofit an existing building without the stream
mr. seidman says he turned down a lexus franchise in part because the building was gorgeous but very expensive
to head off arguments infiniti offers dealers cash bonuses and low-interest construction loans
dictation device 's saga plays back a lesson
products don't have to be first to be winners
that 's the lesson offered through one case study featured in a design exhibit
dictaphone corp. was caught off guard in 1974 when its main competitor lanier office products of japan introduced a microcassette dictation recorder half the size of standard cassette devices
blocked by patent protection from following suit dictaphone decided to go a step further and cut the cassette in half again down to the length of a paperclip
by 1979 designers and engineers at dictaphone a pitney bowes subsidiary had produced a working model of a picocassette recorder
by 1982 however the patent status of the lanier microcassette had changed permitting dictaphone to develop its own competitive micro system which it did
marketing and sales departments then urged abandonment of the pico project
but others said pico should proceed
both were right
dictaphone went ahead and introduced the pico in 1985 but it has n't sold well
to date says emil jachmann a dictaphone vice president it has broken even or shown a small loss
nevertheless the device has been successful in other ways
it helped dictaphone attract better engineers and it provided new technology for other company products
the picocassette recorder also helped transform the company 's reputation from follower to leading-edge innovator
it gave me great pride to see the inventor of the microcassette in japan look at the pico and shake his head and say unbelievable says mr. jachmann
dictaphone 's picocassette recorder is one of 13 case studies in the triad design project sponsored by the design management institute of boston and harvard business school
the studies are on exhibit at harvard this month and will travel to chicago 's institute of design and the university of california at berkeley
a rake 's progress means branching out
one day carl barrett of mobile ala. was raking some sycamore leaves but the rake kept riding up over the piles
the harder he tried to push them into large piles the closer he came to breaking the rake and straining his back
so mr. barrett then vice president of the alabama steamship association took a steel-toothed garden rake and taped it to the underside of a leaf rake about nine inches up
his crude device worked the lower teeth gathered the leaves into a pile while the higher harder teeth moved the top of the pile
now incorporated into a polypropylene rake the four-inch prongs or wonderbars also are supposed to aid in picking up leaves
one customer donald blaggs of mobile says the barrett rake allowed him to do his lawn in 2 1/2 hours two hours less than usual
but other rake makers have their doubts
richard mason president of ames co. in parkersburg w. va. says the barrett rake makes sense but it would be tough to explain to consumers
john stoner marketing director for true temper corp. a subsidiary of black & decker says people do n't want to move a leaf pile
they either pick it up he says or they start pulling from a fresh direction

the pentagon is a haunted house
living there for six years was really scary
the ghosts of the past are everywhere they are kept at bay only by feeding them vast quantities of our defense budget
some can be bought off relatively cheaply
during the korean war gen. douglas macarthur demanded and got in addition to his u.n. command in korea his own naval command in japan navforjapan
those obsolete operations cost less than $ 2 billion a year and keep mac 's ghost quiet
that 's about all it costs to appease adm. erich raeder 's ghost
in 1941 raeder and the german navy threatened to attack the panama canal so we created the southern command in panama
the southern command has grown even bigger since the war because raeder 's ghost sometimes runs through the e ring dressed like gen. noriega
the command 's huge bureaucracy is needed to analyze whether leaders of coups against gen. noriega meet the war powers act 's six points cap weinberger 's seven points the intelligence committee 's 32 points and woodrow wilson 's 14 points necessary to justify u.s. support
so far no one has
the ghost of the soviet brigade discovered in cuba back in the '70s costs just a few hundred million the price of the caribbean command in key west that president carter created in 1980
the brigade has n't been heard from since but we keep the staff around just in case
george marshall 's ghost is much more difficult to keep happy
we keep a lot of shrines to him around the pentagon statues busts relics and such
the army headquarters on the third deck of the pentagon used to burn a lot of incense to him but the navy headquarters on the fourth deck made them stop it
you see marshall had this thing about the navy and the marines he wanted to make them part of the army but secretary of the navy james forrestal blocked him
now his ghost wo n't let up till it 's done
to keep him quiet we invent a new unified command every year or so run by the army or the air force and put more of the navy and marines under it
but we still hear him moaning at night because the navy has a few ships left and to satisfy him the navy 's sea lift forces were given to a new air force bureaucracy in illinois its space operations to another command in colorado the frogmen to a new army bureaucracy in fort bragg and the navy 's indian ocean and persian gulf forces to an army bureaucracy in florida
which brings up the worst and meanest ghost of all the ghost of the shah of iran
when the shah died president carter was so scared that the shah 's ghost would blame him for shoving him out to make way for the ayatollah that he declared the carter doctrine
mr. carter said he would go to war to stop anyone from trying to grab iran
but that ghost would n't settle for words he wanted money and people lots
so mr. carter formed three new army divisions and gave them to a new bureaucracy in tampa called the rapid deployment force
but that ghost was n't fooled he knew the rdf was neither rapid nor deployable nor a force even though it cost $ 8 billion or $ 10 billion a year
after mr. carter was defeated in 1980 the shah 's ghost claimed the credit and then went after president reagan and cap weinberger
i saw what he did to them firsthand
it made my shoelaces dance with terror
why he used to lay in wait for cap suddenly he 'd leap from behind some statue of marshall onto cap 's chest and grab him by the throat and choke him till he coughed up an additional $ 2 billion or so
cap added four more divisions to the army two active and two reserve two carrier groups to the navy a division equivalent to the marines and the c-5b kc-10 c-17 and a thousand tactical aircraft to the air force
he bought $ 4 billion in prepositioning ships and $ 7 billion in ammo and equipment to fill them and parked them at a new $ 6 billion base at diego garcia in the middle of the indian ocean
he dedicated all these new forces to the persian gulf
one night both marshall 's ghost and the shah 's ghost together caught cap and threw him to the ground
before they let him go he added a thousand bureaucrats to the rdf in tampa and renamed it central command
he gave those bureaucrats charge of all naval operations in the persian gulf and indian ocean
marshall figured it would be good training for those soldiers someday maybe they would get the whole navy
they had fun moving the carriers around but it turned out that they had forgotten all about mine sweepers
but the shah still kept leaping out at cap so cap bought a hundred merchant ships more and $ 7 billion of loading barges ramps etc. in order that those seven new army divisions and three marine brigades could unload from all those new ships and aircraft and go to war in the zagros mountains
then suddenly ike 's ghost came to visit and said what the hell are you doing planning for a land war in asia 12,000 miles away
we 'd get our asses kicked
lucky for cap ike was easygoing and soon went away while the shah he kept coming back
so the u.s. found itself paying about $ 2 billion in baksheesh to various arab potentates for basing rights around the indian ocean
we had great success in somalia
but then it turned out that president siad barrah was not at all a nice person and the navy pointed out that the base he promised us in berbera had silted up about a hundred years ago and anyway was 1,244 miles from the mouth of the gulf
but who 's counting
still berbera was the best we could get so we stay in bed with president barrah
all these reports about him committing genocide are probably exaggerated anyway
but would n't you know now that we are spending jillions of dollars and have built those new divisions and new air wings and have positioned all these ships and supplies to fight the russians in iran the russians seem to have lost interest in the whole subject
meanwhile congress is cutting huge chunks out of the rest of the defense budget
predictably some navy guys said do we still need to keep all 18 army divisions on active duty and all those extra land-based aircraft without bases and all those army guys playing admiral in tampa
could n't we save $ 20 billion or $ 30 billion a year by shifting that stuff to the reserves
and why not save the costs of a thousand bureaucrats by abolishing central command and putting responsibility for gulf naval operations back where it belongs afloat with the task force commander in the gulf
and where were all our handsomely paid indian ocean allies last year when our convoys were being attacked
questions like that really stir up marshall 's ghost
he appeared late one night in the bedroom of the new defense secretary dick cheney
marshall came clanking in like marley 's ghost dragging those chains of brigades and air wings and links with arab despots
he would n't leave until mr. cheney promised to do whatever the pentagon systems analysts told him
so next day mr. cheney went out and did just that he canceled the 600-ship navy and cut back one carrier and 20 frigates
then he canceled production of the navy 's most important carrier aircraft the f-14 and the a-6
on the other hand mr. cheney retained all those new land forces
marshall 's ghost is satisfied for now but he 'll be back
what with halloween coming and bigger defense cuts looming more and more pentagon bureaucrats are crawling under their desks
they know that they can hold off the ghosts only a little while longer by cutting carriers and ships
then the whole thing will start to collapse just as it did in the 1970s and the ghosts and banshees will be howling through the place turning people 's hair white
gives me the willies just thinking about it
mr. lehman a reagan navy secretary is a managing director of painewebber
the metal and marble lobby of centrust bank 's headquarters is grander than your average savings and loan
for one thing there is an old master on the wall samuel anointing david a big baroque canvas painted by mattia preti a 17th-century neapolitan
at the moment however the painting is a nagging reminder of the problems that have engulfed centrust and its flamboyant chairman and chief executive david l. paul
in an international buying spree that began barely two years ago mr. paul amassed a collection of about 30 pre-18th-century works including the preti at a total cost of $ 28 million
by midnight oct. 6 all of the paintings were supposed to have been sold off under orders from florida 's comptroller whose office regulates the state 's s&ls
centrust did n't meet the deadline
the collection was at the heart of a grandiose plan mr. paul had in which the art was to do double duty as an investment for centrust and as decoration for the s&l 's new office tower designed by i.m. pei
the rub is that the $ 28 million was plucked from the funds of this federally insured institution even as centrust was losing money hand over fist
mr. paul had no right to buy art for the s&l in the first place it is n't on the comptroller 's permissible list without seeking a special dispensation which he did not do
besides that some of the paintings that were to grace the walls of centrust actually ended up hanging in the chairman 's estate on la gorce isle off miami beach
last spring the comptroller 's office called a halt to mr. paul 's fling giving him six months to sell the paintings
the acquisitions officials said in a letter to mr. paul were unsafe unsound and unauthorized
so far mr. paul has unloaded but three of his masterpieces he wo n't say to whom
the comptroller 's office says it is monitoring the situation
though the agency could remove mr. paul it has no current intention to do that
it 's not like selling chevrolets mr. paul says as he takes a drag on a goldbanded st. moritz cigarette
the last six months has established the quality of the collection
there 's no fire sale here
despite mr. paul 's characteristic hauteur the 50-year-old chain-smoking dynamo is finding that getting centrust florida 's largest thrift institution out of its riskiest investments is much tougher than getting into them had been
paintings are just part of the picture
although mr. paul has pared a $ 1.35 billion junk-bond portfolio to less than $ 900 million since april the high-yield debt market has plummeted
divesting itself of what is left as is required of all thrift institutions by july 1994 under the new federal s&l bailout law may well prove difficult
and centrust has other problems
late last week federal regulators ordered the thrift institution to stop paying dividends on its preferred stock a move that suggests deep concern about an institution
mr. paul has a plan to bring in $ 150 million by selling off 63 of centrust 's 71 branches but it has yet to be approved by regulators
it is mr. paul 's art venture however that has drawn the most attention from investors and regulators not to mention galleries throughout the world
embittered shareholders some of whom are suing say the chairman and his collection epitomize the excesses of speculation that set off the national s&l crisis
centrust shares have fallen sharply in price from a high of $ 15.125 in 1986 to close yesterday at $ 2.875
gallery directors meanwhile say mr. paul and others of his ilk have left an indelible mark on the art world and not for the better
collectors do n't say it 's a van gogh anymore laments harry brooks the president of wildenstein & co. a new york gallery
they say johnny payson got $ 53 million for his so certainly $ 10 million is n't too much for mine
the great collectors we depended on such as paul mellon or norton simon have stopped buying and the new buyers are brilliant men who made money in the stock market or in takeovers and rushed into collecting
mr. payson an art dealer and collector sold vincent van gogh 's irises at a sotheby 's auction in november 1987 to australian businessman alan bond
trouble is mr. bond has yet to pay up and until he does sotheby 's has the painting under lock and key
when mr. paul moved in on the art market he let it be known that virtually no piece was too costly to be considered by centrust
he established his reputation as a freespender in january last year at sotheby 's auction of the linda and gerald guterman collection in new york
there on one of his first shopping trips mr. paul picked up several paintings at stunning prices
he paid $ 2.2 million for instance for a still life by jan jansz. den uyl that was expected to fetch perhaps $ 700,000
the price paid was a record for the artist
some 64 % of items offered at the guterman auction were sold at an average price of $ 343,333
the rest were withdrawn for lack of acceptable bids
afterward mr. paul is said by mr. guterman to have phoned mr. guterman the new york developer selling the collection and gloated
he says he stole them recalls mr. guterman
and he tells me if you want to see your paintings you 'll have to come to my house in florida
mr. paul denies phoning and gloating
it 's just not true he says
mr. paul quickly became more aggressive in his collecting with the help of george wachter a sotheby 's expert in old masters whom he met at an exhibition of the guterman items
mr. wachter who became his principal adviser searched galleries in london paris and monaco
and according to one dealer mr. wachter had a penchant for introducing mr. paul with the phrase he can buy anything
nicholas hall the president of the colnaghi u.s.a. ltd. gallery in new york sold mr. paul abraham and sarah in the wilderness by giovanni battista tiepolo
mr. hall says mr. paul was known to spend a lot of money
people were interested in seeing him but it was recognized that the route was through sotheby 's and particularly george wachter
mr. paul thus developed a close symbiotic relationship with sotheby 's
mr. paul was eager to assemble a collection for the headquarters centrust has been moving into for the greater part of a year
sotheby 's the auction house founded in london 1744 and now under the umbrella of sotheby 's holdings inc. was hoping to stir up interest in old masters as it strove to build its u.s. business
european dealers continued to dominate the action in old masters which sotheby 's north america had lately been touting in this country
for several months there was optimism all around
last october mr. paul paid out $ 12 million of centrust 's cash plus a $ 1.2 million commission for portrait of a man as mars
the painting attributed to flemish artist peter paul rubens was purchased privately through sotheby 's not at auction
in march 1989 just 15 months into his campaign mr. paul was named by art & antiques magazine as one of the top 100 individual collectors in the u.s
an unknown quantity to most of the art world paul is no stranger to lavish spending the magazine said noting that he does n't stop at paint on canvas but also spends big on art you can eat
he recently bid $ 30,000 at a paris charity auction for a dinner cooked by six of the world 's great chefs but the final party cost closer to $ 100,000
mr. paul says it was n't that high
the art collection might have come to rival the medicis ' had the florida comptroller 's office not got wind of mr. paul 's aesthetic adventure
in its letter to him dated march 2 and shared with reporters alex hager the chief of the thrift-institution bureau in the comptroller 's office expressed puzzlement that the s&l could be so profligate when it had reported losses of more than $ 13 million in its two preceding quarters
the state gave centrust 30 days to sell the rubens
the comptroller 's office eventually extended the deadline to six months but broadened its demands ordering that the book value of the collection be reduced to zero
in other words get rid of all the pictures
the state obliquely noted that unsafe banking practices are grounds for removing an officer or director and closed with the admonition to mr. paul govern yourself accordingly
the state agency was particularly vexed to learn that the rubens and a half-dozen other paintings listed among the bank 's furniture and fixtures were actually hanging in the chairman 's house
mr. paul says that at one point he did indeed have eight or nine of the paintings at home and that the rest were in storage at sotheby 's
he explains that he was merely storing the paintings at home with some display because of the special dehumidified environment required for their safekeeping until centrust 's new building was ready for them
still the incident was embarrassing
it came on the heels of a number of local newspaper articles suggesting that mr. paul has benefited handsomely from his association with centrust
for instance he got a $ 3 million loan from the s&l negotiated at a below-market rate
he owns 43 % of centrust 's shares
adding to mr. paul 's problems dealers some with vested interests insist that he relying rather too heavily on sotheby 's advice paid much too much for several pieces in the centrust collection
the $ 12 million lavished on the rubens for example was a record price for the artist and maybe twice its value given a dispute among scholars about its provenance
david tunick the president of david tunick inc. a new york gallery says scholars question the authenticity of the rubens
it may have been painted instead by a rubens associate
the feeling among many experts on the commercial side is that the price paid at the time was excessive in any event mr. tunick says
it sounds like with the rubens he got absolutely taken to the cleaners
victor wiener the executive director of the appraisers association of america agrees that mr. paul paid very dearly for the rubens and adds that getting rid of it any time soon for a similar sum would be quite a feat
it 's not beyond credibility the rubens will someday be worth $ 12 million but whether it could be sold for that amount tomorrow remains to be seen
still predicting is tricky
i 'm forever dumbfounded by what i see making these high prices
jonathan h. kress the son of the painting 's former owner mrs. rush kress dismisses the price talk as sour grapes
dealers contemptuous of the purchase price he says were themselves interested in buying the rubens but lost out
mr. paul for his part defends the rubens price saying a lot of the experts have never seen the thing itself
most of them were n't even born the last time the painting was displayed publicly he says
art prices are skyrocketing but a good deal of legerdemain is involved in compiling statistics on sales
salomon brothers inc. the investment-banking firm in its annual tally of investment returns reported that old masters appreciated 51 % in the year ended june 1 the greatest return of any of 13 assets it tracked
impressionist and modern paintings not tracked by salomon are ranked even higher at 74 % by sotheby 's
salomon moreover gets its data on art appreciation from sotheby 's whose prices go up with clients like mr. paul in its thrall
the percentages omit from consideration the many paintings that go begging at auction
art indexes track winners not losers
but art that has fallen sharply in value is rarely put up for sale
also at any of sotheby 's auctions of old masters roughly one-third to one-fifth of what is offered does n't sell at any price
it 's not that there are n't any bids but the bids do n't meet the minimum reserve prices set by the sellers
in january the preti painting that now hangs at centrust was expected to bring no more than $ 700,000 at auction until mr. paul came along with his $ 1.15 million
mr. hall of the colnaghi gallery says $ 1.15 million would have been an impossible price for anyone to ask for a preti four years ago
but from his vantage point it is n't that mr. paul a customer of his too overpaid for the work a gargantuan painting by an artist who is not a household word
the painting is 10 feet wide seven feet high
rather it just shows things have changed
mr. paul boasts that he spotted bargains in old masters just before they took an upward turn
they went up 51 % last year and they 'll do it again this year he declares
they were a sleeper
everybody was out buying monets
sotheby 's vice president diana levitt says the auction house has been assisting mr. paul in selling the paintings
and while sotheby 's chief rivals in the art world private art dealers wo n't be happy to hear it she adds a number of the artworks have already been sold and at a substantial profit
mr. paul claims to have sold three paintings at more than a 10 % profit
that is n't 51 % and the claim is n't documented
he furthermore denies that he relied too heavily on sotheby 's or mr. wachter
mr. paul says he had not one but four advisers and that he never bid impulsively
after all he had the counsel of curators from the most reputable museums in the world
he says he expects to sell the collection including the controversial rubens carefully and prudently just as it was put together
but in art-world parlance mr. paul 's holdings are burnt
that is he is being compelled to put them on the market too soon and has already gotten offers that are less than he paid for some of the art works
after a few years you can argue there has been natural appreciation says susan theran the publisher of leonard 's annual price index of art auctions
but quick turnover in artwork is like pawning your jewelry you end up with 50 %
people hold out and try to get a bargain
sotheby 's defends itself and mr. paul in the matter
mr. wachter says mr. paul was a quick study who worked intensely and bought the best pictures available at the moment
on occasion he paid a high price mr. wachter concedes but he says those who bid less and dropped out were dealers who would then have marked up the paintings to resell them at a profit to collectors
naomi bernhard levinson a fine-arts appraiser at bernhard associates in san francisco considers it definite conflict of interest for an auction house to both advise a client on purchases and to set price estimates on the paintings to be purchased
sotheby 's she says is wearing both hats
i ca n't see why there would be a conflict of interest says sotheby 's ms. levitt
estimates are based on the previous price of similar works sold at auction and current market conditions and are not affected by any knowledge of who the potential buyer could be
frequently clients express interest in paintings but do n't end up bidding she adds so we do n't know who the potential buyer will be
mr. paul in selling off his paintings is seeking at least a 15 % return on the bank 's investment so as to prove that the venture was sound
mr. paul says that he has feelers out over much of the globe and that potential buyers from as far away as japan and italy have examined the collection
because of the pressure on centrust to sell dealers and collectors have been trying to get the paintings at bargain-basement prices
but so far mr. paul and his advisers are holding fast
one dealer martin zimet of french & co. in new york says he would have loved to buy a jan davids de heem painting from the bank
i tried to steal the picture to buy it attractively and sotheby 's would n't do it
they were protecting his interests
meanwhile mr. paul and centrust executives are getting squeamish about opulence
mr. paul has been characterized as the great gatsby or something complains karen e. brinkman an executive vice president of centrust
the media she says have distorted his personal life
mr. paul nods in agreement
i do n't think i have a life style that is frankly so flamboyant he says
but at just that moment he is interrupted in his office by a servant in tuxedo who pours coffee from silver into a cup of china and dabs the brim with linen
mr. paul says yes the ceiling in his executive suite is gold-leaf inlay
the offices are done in hardwood and oriental rugs leatherbound books and of course a $ 12 million rubens
but he implores that the splendor be played down
do n't say it 's a gold ceiling
just say the offices are tastefully appointed he says
otherwise the regulators will take it for decadence and nowadays everything 's got to be pristine
figures do n't include taxes or transaction costs
companies listed below reported quarterly profit substantially different from the average of analysts ' estimates

estimated and actual results involving losses are omitted
the percent difference compares actual profit with the 30-day estimate where at least three analysts have issues forecasts in the past 30 days
otherwise actual profit is compared with the 300-day estimate
during its centennial year the wall street journal will report events of the past century that stand as milestones of american business history
creative accounting mostly by conglomerates forced cpas to change their way of setting standards to be followed by corporations reporting financial results standards that had become all too flexible
the new financial accounting standards board fasb was created in 1972 to replace the accounting principles board of the american institute of certified public accountants
all of the former board 's members were cpas provoking conflict-of-interest criticism because they were writing rules while handling clients ' books at the same time
the new board 's seven-member structure kept four cpas but the others were from industry and academia
francis m. wheat a former securities and exchange commission member headed the panel that had studied the issues for a year and proposed the fasb on march 30 1972
the former board had produced 21 opinions and 1,000 critics in its 12-year life its chairman had conceded
the climate was right for the new fasb
in the late 1960s some cpas failed to correct such abuses as clients picking permissive rules that hyped earnings and stock prices
and in november 1970 congress had passed a special act to overrule one board rule
also james needham an sec commissioner in april 1972 had warned that the industry might face a federal agency writing accounting rules if they rejected the fasb idea
keepers of the books dubbed figure filberts loathed the threat
the fasb had its initial meeting on march 28 1973

revenue rose 3 % to $ 1.52 billion from $ 1.48 billion
reynolds is the third big aluminum company since friday to report disappointing earnings
the no. 1 domestic aluminum producer aluminum co. of america friday said its earnings fell 3.2 % to $ 219 million or $ 2.46 a share
and alcan aluminium ltd. yesterday reported net income slid 30 % to $ 180 million or 77 cents a share from $ 258 million or $ 1.07 a share
analysts on average had been expecting about $ 2.70 for alcoa and $ 1 for alcan
it 's a good indication that level of profitability has peaked for the industry says vahid fathi metals analyst with prescott ball & turben inc. who had estimated reynolds would earn about $ 2.35 a share
the nation 's no. 2 aluminum company said earnings were hurt by lower prices for certain fabricated aluminum products which typically follow price fluctuations of primary ingots
the base metal price has dropped 30.3 % from a year earlier to 78 cents a pound
much of the price decline has been blamed on a slowing economy and the third quarter is typically the industry 's slowest period
but william o. bourke chairman and chief executive officer said the ingot price appears to have bottomed out
he said shipments are continuing at a healthy pace and the company has no excess inventory
aluminum shipments of 329,600 metric tons were nearly equal to the year-earlier period the company said
nevertheless the company said that in the latest quarter there were increased material and labor costs including a new employee profit-sharing plan
in composite trading on the new york stock exchange reynolds closed at $ 55.375 up $ 1.25
no strikeout but certainly no home run
that 's how the stock-picking game is shaping up for the months ahead according to money managers and a few brokers
yesterday 's 88-point recovery from friday 's megadrop in the dow jones industrials had many brokerage houses proclaiming that stocks are a good bargain again
but quite a few money managers are n't buying it
weakening corporate earnings they say are no prescription for a bull market
the stock market ai n't going to do much of anything for a while says john neff of wellington management who runs the $ 8.3 billion windsor fund
he suspects that friday 's market decline may have a second leg perhaps a 10 % to 15 % drop later on
mr. neff says the stock market has lost some powerful driving forces namely earnings growth and the lbo sweepstakes buy-out fever that induced investors to bid up whole groups of stocks such as media and airlines
after sitting with 20 % of his fund in cash before friday 's sell-off mr. neff says he bought a narrow list of stocks yesterday
with flat corporate profits on the horizon for 1990 money managers say price-earnings multiples that look cheap today might go on being cheap for a long time
this is not a grossly overvalued market but it 's not cheap either says george collins president of the mutual fund company t. rowe price associates in baltimore
according to institutional brokers estimate system wall street market strategists see only a 2.4 % jump in company profits in 1990 unlike in 1987 when profits a year out looked good they did soar 36 % in 1988
bulls say the market is an incredible bargain priced at only about 12 times estimated 1989 earnings for stocks in the standard & poor 's 500 index
before the 1987 crash the p/e was more than 20
the common view says abby cohen strategist for drexel burnham lambert is that there will be mild economic growth modest profit expansion and things are going to be hunky-dory
our view is that we may see a profit decline
some think investors should sell into rallies
the market is going to wind down says gerald w. perritt a chicago money manager
things are a little less overpriced after friday 's jolt in the market
he expects stocks to decline an additional 5 % to 30 % with the dow perhaps bottoming out between 2000 and 2100 between now and june
after friday 's decline mr. perritt 's firm ran statistical tests on 100 high-quality stocks using old-fashioned value criteria devised by benjamin graham an analyst and author in the 1930s and 1940s who is widely considered to be the father of modern securities analysis
he found 85 still overvalued and 15 fairly valued
nicholas parks a new york money manager expects the market to decline about 15 %
i 've been two-thirds in cash since july and i continue to think that having a defensive position is appropriate he says
companies that piled on debt in leveraged buy-outs during the past two years will continue to surface as business problems
generalizations about value are n't useful says new york money manager john lefrere of delta capital management
for instance he says international business machines and unisys might look cheap but investors might continue to do better with stocks like walt disney procter & gamble and coca-cola strong performers in recent years
money manager robert ross head of duncan ross associates ltd. in vancouver british columbia says stocks would have to fall 15 % to 20 % before they are competitive with less risky investment alternatives
fredric russell a money manager in tulsa okla. says friday 's cave-in is going to have more of a permanent impact on the psyche of many investors than wall street would want to admit
there are still bulls out there
i still think we will have a 3000 dow whether it 's six months or 12 months from now i do n't know says david dreman managing partner of dreman value management in new york
we 're doing a little buying in some stocks that have really been smashed down
many brokerage house officials also are optimistic
yesterday goldman sachs merrill lynch and dean witter all increased the proportion of assets they recommend investors commit to stocks
dean witter now recommends 85 % goldman 65 % and merrill lynch 50 %
some investors say friday 's sell-off was a good thing because it deflated a lot of crazy takeover speculation
it was a healthy cleansing says michael holland who runs salomon brothers asset management in new york
from here out these investors see a return to old-fashioned investing based on a company 's ability to show profit growth
the fundamentals are pretty strong mr. dreman says
i do n't see this as a bear market at all
it 's a recognition that there was much too much fluff in the lbo market
friday 's big fall was just a blunder by the stock market says john connolly chief strategist for dean witter
it was an overreaction to an event the failure of a management and union group to get bank financing for a takeover of ual that does n't mean that much to lots of stocks
many investors have nagging worries however
newspapers are full of headlines about companies defaulting on their debts and banks writing off real estate loans
that hurts investors ' confidence in the economy and stocks
not even all the brokerage firms see clear sailing ahead
disappointing profits are likely to get worse in the next two quarters says mary farrell a market strategist at painewebber
she thinks the market could drop about 10 % in the next few months then recover and go higher
companies with steady earnings growth could do well she says while others with high debt or poor earnings could see their shares decline far more than 10 %
the turmoil on wall street may benefit some retailers attempting to lead leveraged buy-outs of their specialty and department-store chains investment bankers and retailers said
managers at five chains have said in recent weeks that they intend to bid for their companies
the chains include bloomingdale 's owned by campeau corp. toronto saks fifth avenue and marshall field 's owned by b.a.t industries plc london and b. altman & co. and sakowitz inc. owned by hooker corp. which is now being managed by a court-appointed provisional liquidator
hooker is based in sydney australia
the combination of so many chains available for sale the recent failures of such retailing lbo 's as miller & rhoads inc. and declining investor confidence will drive down prices retailing observers said
the pricing will become more realistic which should help management said bruce rosenthal a new york investment banker with nathan s. jonas & co
investors are n't going to be throwing money at any of the proposed lbos but doing deals on the basis of ridiculous assumptions never made sense either
earlier this year bankers and other investors were willing to provide financing because they assumed there would be major gains in both profitability and sales mr. rosenthal added
those days are over now he believes
competition from third parties who have cash and are prepared to buy has always existed and will continue added mr. rosenthal
but when prices were crazy it was even harder to do an lbo
bankers believed in the greater-fool theory that says somebody else is always willing to pay more
this is no longer true today
at saks fifth avenue paul leblang senior vice president marketing agreed that lower prices will help his management team in their proposed lbo
having to take on less debt would certainly be an advantage said mr. leblang
it would also help us in our search for equity partners
to make an lbo work now we are going to need more than just junk bonds
none believe the proposed management lbos will be easy to complete especially at b. altman & co. which is under chapter 11 bankruptcy protection
not only could the wall street gyrations damp christmas sales if consumers lose confidence in the economy but potential junk-bond buyers are sure to demand even stronger covenants and greater management equity participation
further many institutions today holding troubled retailers ' debt securities will be reticent to consider additional retailing investments
it 's called bad money driving out good money said one retailing observer
institutions that usually buy retail paper have to be more concerned
however the lower prices these retail chains are now expected to bring should make it easier for managers to raise the necessary capital and pay back the resulting debt
in addition the fall selling season has generally been a good one especially for those retailers dependent on apparel sales for the majority of their revenues
what 's encouraging about this is that retail chains will be sold on the basis of their sales and earnings not liquidation values said joseph e. brooks chairman and chief executive officer of ann taylor inc. a specialty chain
retailers who had good track records of producing profits will have a better chance to buy back their companies
still most retailing observers expect that all the proposed retailing lbos will depend partly on the sale of junk bonds a market already in tumult in part because of concerns associated with bonds issued by the federated and allied units of campeau
prices for retail chains are lower today than they were last week which will help management said gilbert harrison chairman of financo inc. an investment-banking firm specializing in retailing acquisitions
but the hurdle of financing still has to be resolved
potential bondholders will either look for greater equity participation on behalf of management or insist the equity component of the deals be substantially greater than in the past
sony corp. won a pretrial order blocking u.s. sales of justin products inc. 's my own line of portable audio players for children
judge john e. sprizzo issued the order in manhattan federal court where sony has accused the tiny company of illegally knocking off the my first sony line
the judge held that the combination of colors used for the sony products is distinctive and subject to protection under new york state law rather than federal law
the legal fight was the subject of a wall street journal story yesterday
justin 's attorney charles e. baxley said justin would ask an appeals court to set aside the order temporarily pending an expedited appeal
he also repeated justin 's denial of sony 's charges
their likelihood of reversing us is very slim said lewis h. eslinger sony 's attorney who said he doubts justin will go ahead with a trial
continental mortgage & equity trust said it will resume dividend payments with a 10-cent-a-share payout on nov. 6 to shares of record oct. 25

a federal appeals court struck down a natural-gas regulation that had prevented pipeline companies from passing to customers part of $ 1 billion in costs from controversial take-or-pay contracts
the court in a 3-0 ruling threw out a deadline set by the federal energy regulatory commission for settling old contract disputes over gas that the pipeline companies reserved but did n't use
ferc 's regulation had given pipelines until march 31 1989 to pass on to customers as much as 50 % of the costs of buying out their broken contracts which were made with producers when gas prices were high and supplies short
a majority of old contracts were renegotiated by the deadline and settled at steep discounts
but pipeline companies estimate they still face $ 2.4 billion in liabilities from unresolved disputes including $ 1 billion they fear they wo n't be able to pass on to customers
according to industry lawyers the ruling gives pipeline companies an important second chance to resolve remaining disputes and take advantage of the cost-sharing mechanism
the court left open whether ferc could reimpose a new deadline later
the court agreeing with pipeline companies found the march 31 deadline was arbitrary and capricious and highly prejudicial to the bargaining power of pipelines that were forced to negotiate settlement of the old take-or-pay contracts to meet the deadline
a report last month by the interstate natural gas association of america found that pipelines ' settlement costs had jumped in the three months before the deadline to 39 cents on the dollar from 22 cents on the dollar in 1988
the court ordered ferc to justify within 60 days not only its cost-sharing deadline but other major elements of its proposed regulation for introducing more competition into natural-gas transportation
the court also questioned a crediting mechanism that could be used to resolve take-or-pay liabilities
the complex regulation known in the industry as order 500 has been hotly contested by all sides including natural-gas producers pipelines local distribution companies and consumers
the court 's decision would allow ferc to change some of its provisions but ensures it will be reviewed again quickly by the court

mlx corp. said it reached a preliminary agreement with senior lenders to its refrigeration and air-conditioning group to restructure the $ 188.5 million of credit facilities the lenders provide to the group
mlx which also makes aircraft and heavy-duty truck parts said the debt was accumulated during its acquisition of nine businesses that make up the group the biggest portion of which was related to the 1986 purchase of a hillman co. unit
among other things the restructured facilities will substantially reduce the group 's required amortization of the term loan portion of the credit facilities through september 1992 mlx said
certain details of the restructured facilities remain to be negotiated
the agreement is subject to completion of a definitive amendment and appropriate approvals
william p. panny mlx chairman and chief executive said the pact will provide mlx with the additional time and flexibility necessary to complete the restructuring of the company 's capital structure

angel gurria mexico 's top debt negotiator said the country 's creditor banks are responding positively to mexico 's debt-reduction package
mr. gurria 's optimism contrasts with some bankers ' views that the deal may require a lot of arm twisting by the u.s. treasury in order to succeed

korean car exports have slid about 40 % so far this year but auto makers here are n't panicking
they are enjoying domestic sales that are more than making up for lost overseas sales
south korean consumers are expected to buy almost 500,000 passenger cars this year up 60 % from 1988
in fact some auto executives suggest that slackened demand for their cars in the u.s. and canada is a blessing otherwise they would n't be able to keep up with demand in the more profitable local market
we are very lucky to easily change an export loss to domestic plus says hong tu pyo managing director of domestic marketing for hyundai motor co
as it is waiting lists of a month are n't unusual for popular models
demand is so strong that all of the domestic makers hyundai kia motors corp. daewoo motor co. and even upstart ssangyong motor co. plan to build more factories
industry analysts predict that by 1995 south korea will be building three million cars a year about half of that for export
it 's an optimistic move in a industry already facing world-wide overcapacity
but south korean auto makers are confident that the export market will bounce back and that demand in korea will stay strong
currently only one in 38 south koreans owns a car up from one in 200 a decade ago
in the year 2000 it will be one car per family
at that point domestic sales will slow down says kim yoon kwon director of marketing for daewoo motor
the reason for the tremendous demand is simple south koreans suddenly have a lot more money
we never thought we 'd own a car says kwang ok kyong who just bought a daewoo lemans on a five-year loan
she and her husband started a small printing business and need the car for work as well as for weekend jaunts
pay raises of 60 % over the past three years have given many south koreans the money to enjoy the things they were supplying the rest of the world
the success of newcomer ssangyong motor shows the strength of the auto market and its growing diversity
a part of the construction-oriented conglomerate ssangyong group it took over the dying dong-a motor co. in 1986
ssangyong began making variations of the jeep-like korando vehicle
dong-a had had a technology agreement with jeep maker american motors corp. now a part of chrysler corp
the most popular style is the stretched family which resembles a ford bronco or chevy blazer
the four-wheel-drive vehicles start at $ 15,000 a family can cost over $ 25,000
ssangyong which has only about 3 % of the domestic market will sell about 18,000 of its models this year twice as many as last year
it sees sales rising 45 % to 26,000 units next year
the company plans to expand plant capacity 50 % by 1991
by then it also hopes to begin producing a passenger car based on the volvo 240 and selling for about $ 20,000
hyundai and daewoo seem unconcerned about the ssangyong threat but kia the scrappy no.3 auto maker is selling four-wheel-drive vehicles through its asia unit
it plans to sell 1,700 units in 1989
kia the only korean car maker that has seen its overseas sales grow in 1989 aims at korea 's common man
its advantage has been the peppy little pride sold as the ford festiva in the u.s
at 3.8 million won or $ 5,700 the econobox is the lowest-priced car in south korea
along with two larger models the company claims 18 % of the domestic market
ford motor co. and japan 's mazda motor corp. have equity interests in kia
kia is the most aggressive of the korean big three in offering financing
loans for as long as five years make the cars very accessible with monthly payments as low as 80,000 won or $ 120
daewoo motor a 50-50 joint venture with general motors corp. and the daewoo group conglomerate is the only auto maker that appears to be hurting
shipments of its lemans to gm 's pontiac division are off about 65 % from a year ago versus a 44 % decline for hyundai and an 18 % increase for kia
moreover daewoo 's domestic sales have grown half as fast as sales of its rivals
the big problem for daewoo which holds about 21 % of the market is the long series of labor disruptions it suffered this year
but daewoo is expanding too
in fact a sister company daewoo shipbuilding and heavy machinery plans to build 240,000 minicars by the mid-1990s
hyundai the korean market leader with a 58 % share also plans to jump into minicars at the same time
it has a similar project for 200,000 cars a year
kia is reportedly also considering such a plan
even giant samsung group is rumored in the korean press to be considering getting into the auto-making business a company spokesman had no comment

many skittish mutual fund investors picked up the phone yesterday but decided not to cash in their chips after all
as the stock market bounced back withdrawals of money from stock funds amounted to a mere trickle compared with black monday when investors dumped $ 2.3 billion or about 2 % of stock-fund assets
fidelity investments the nation 's largest fund company said phone volume was more than double its typical level but still half that of oct. 19 1987
net outflows from fidelity 's stock funds stood at less than $ 300 million or below 15 % of the $ 2 billion cash position of the firm 's stock portfolios
much of the money was switched into the firm 's money market funds
outflows since the close of trading friday remain below one-third their level of two years ago fidelity said
other mutual fund companies reported even lighter withdrawal requests
and some investors at fidelity and elsewhere even began buying stock funds during the day
two years ago there was a lot of redemption activity and trouble with people getting through on the phone said kathryn mcgrath head of the investment management division of the securities and exchange commission
this time we do n't have that at all
of course the relative calm could be jolted if the market plunges again
and any strong surge in redemptions could force some funds to dump stocks to raise cash as some did during black monday
but funds generally are better prepared this time around
as a group their cash position of 10.2 % of assets in august the latest figure available is 14 % higher than two years earlier
many fund managers have boosted their cash levels in recent weeks
the biggest flurry of investor activity came early in the day
vanguard group inc. saw heavy exchanges from stock funds into money market funds after the telephone lines opened at 8:30 a.m
in the first hour the real nervous folks came along a spokesman said
but the horrendous pace of call volume in the first half-hour slowed considerably
at scudder stevens & clark inc. phone calls came in at 40 % more than the normal pace through early afternoon
most of that increase came in the first hour after the phone lines opened at 8 a.m
as stocks rose in fact some investors changed course and reversed their sell orders
many funds allow investors to void orders before the close of trading
at scudder and at the smaller ivy funds group in hingham mass. for instance some shareholders called early in the morning to switch money from stock funds to money market funds but later called back to reverse the switches
because mutual fund trades do n't take effect until the market close in this case at 4 p.m. these shareholders effectively stayed put
at fidelity 's office in downtown boston gerald sherman walked in shortly after 7:30 a.m. and placed an order to switch his retirement accounts out of three stock funds and into a money market fund
but by 3:15 p.m. with the market comfortably ahead for the day mr. sherman was preparing to undo his switch
it 's a nice feeling to know that things stabilized said mr. sherman the 51-year-old co-owner of a discount department store
but some investors continued to switch out of high-risk high-yield junk funds despite yesterday 's rebound from that market 's recent price declines
shareholders have been steadily bailing out of several big junk funds the past several weeks as the $ 200 billion market was jolted by a cash crunch at campeau corp. and steadily declining prices
much of the money has been switched into money market funds fund executives say
instead of selling bonds to meet redemptions however some funds have borrowed from banks to meet withdrawal requests
this avoids knocking down prices further
the $ 1.1 billion t. rowe price high yield fund was among the funds that borrowed during the campeau crisis says george j. collins president of t. rowe price associates inc
that way mr. collins says we did n't have to sell securities in a sloppy market
when the market stabilized he added the firm sold the bonds and quickly paid the loans back

soft contact lenses won federal blessing on march 18 1971 and quickly became eye openers for their makers
the food and drug administration that day said bausch & lomb could start selling them in the u.s
the cornflake-size product was more comfortable and less prone to falling out than hard contact lenses which had been around since 1939
bausch & lomb sold the softies under a sublicense from national patent development which had gained the rights from the czechoslovakia academy of sciences
otto wichterle a czech invented them in 1962
the plastic lens wraps itself over the cornea absorbing eye moisture while permitting oxygen to pass through
but the new lens became the eye of a storm
in september 1971 california officials seized bootlegged lenses made by unlicensed companies after some showed traces of bacteria
in october doctors were debating the product 's safety some claiming it caused infections
and there were senate hearings on the questions in july 1972
the product overcame the bad publicity and kept evolving
the early soft lenses which cost $ 300 a set were expected to last for a year
in 1983 extended wear versions designed to be worn for 30 days at a time wree offered
eighteen months ago a disposable seven-day model bowed a year 's supply costs about $ 500
last month the fda and contact lens institute cautioned users that serious eye infections could result from wearing lenses more than seven days at a stretch
today 20 million of the 25 million americans using contact lenses are using the soft type
including the accesory eye care products contacts account for $ 2 billion in annual retail sales
although bausch remains the leader among the six majors johnson & johnson with its new disposables is coming on fast
the roller-coaster stock market is making life tougher for small companies trying to raise money
in the wake of friday 's plunge and yesterday 's rebound some companies are already postponing deals and others wish they could
as in other jittery times many small businesses expect a particularly rough time raising funds as investors shun risky deals seeking safety in bigger companies
even if stock prices fully recover from friday 's sharp decline the unsettled conditions will frighten many investors
the implication of an unsettled situation is that the thing could drop dramatically says henry linsert jr. chairman of martek corp. a four-year-old biotechnology company that is planning a private placement of stock
the more variables that indicate risk the more the investor is going to drive a hard bargain
earlier this month staples inc. a newton mass. office-supplies discounter said it would accelerate expansion plans nationwide and offer more of its stock to the public
at the time its shares were selling above their initial offering price of $ 19 and bankers believed staples would sell new stock without a hitch
but with the company 's shares standing at $ 15 yesterday a new offering seems unlikely company officials say
business however continues to be robust and the stock market has n't affected the concern 's expansion plans says todd krasnow a senior executive
other companies figure they ca n't avoid the market
we have capital requirements says mr. linsert so we have to go ahead with a planned $ 1.5 billion private placement
unless the market goes right back up he says it may take us six to nine months to find the money instead of three
and the columbia md. company may have to settle for a lower price he adds
life is particularly nerve-racking for companies that had planned to go public this week
hand-holding is becoming an investment-banking job requirement
robertson stephens & co. a san francisco investment banking concern has a client that looked forward to making its initial public offering yesterday
officers of the company a health-care concern were very discouraged on friday and felt they should n't go public we felt they should says sanford robertson partner in the banking concern
as the market dropped friday robertson stephens slashed the value of the offering by 7 %
yesterday when similar securities rebounded it bumped the valuation up again
as of late yesterday the ipo was still on
for many the situation is especially discouraging because the market for ipos was showing signs of strengthening after several years of weakness
we were just beginning to look at the increase in ipos seeing the light at the end of the tunnel says frank kline jr. partner in lambda funds a beverly hills calif. venture capital concern
but the tunnel 's just gotten longer
companies planning to go public are definitely taking a second look says allen hadhazy senior analyst at the institute for econometric research fort lauderdale fla. which publishes the new issues newsletter on ipos
he calculates that the recent market slide translated into a 5 % to 7 % reduction in ipo proceeds to companies
many companies are hesitating
exabyte corp. had been planning to sell 10 % of its stock this week in an ipo that would raise up to $ 28.5 million
but now peter behrendt president says we 're making decisions on a day-to-day basis
debt-free and profitable the boulder colo. computer-products concern could borrow funds if it decides against an ipo now he says
knowledgeware inc. an atlanta computer-software concern says it is still planning to go ahead with its ipo this week or next unless conditions change
it 's a wait-and-see situation right now says terry mcgowan president
delayed financings also would affect the operations of many companies
sierra tucson cos. a tucson ariz. operator of addiction-treatment centers has a planned doubling of capacity riding on an ipo scheduled for next week
william o'donnell president says he still thinks the ipo will succeed
if it does n't he says the company would have to change its expansion timetable
but the market turmoil could be partially beneficial for some small businesses
in a sagging market the federal reserve system might flood the market with funds and that should bring interest rates down says leonard t. anctil vice president of the bank of new england boston
james g. zafris president of danvers savings bank danvers mass. says the market turmoil is an absolute non-event for small business
for small companies he says interest rates are far more important than what happens on stock exchanges
mr. zafris thinks rates are heading down helping small companies
peter drake biotechnology analyst for vector securities international chicago thinks market uncertainty may encourage small companies to form more strategic alliances with big corporations
partly because the 1987 market crash made it harder for them to find financing many high-technology concerns have made such alliances recently
some even see a silver lining in the dark clouds
alan wells president of bollinger wells lett & co. a new york merger specialist thinks panicky investors may lose their enthusiasm for leveraged buy-out and giant takeover deals
instead they could turn to investing in smaller deals involving smaller companies he says
and william e. wetzel jr. a university of new hampshire management professor and director of venture capital network inc. says the market 's gyrations will underline the investors ' lack of control in big stock investments
this will add to the appeal of small business he says where investors often have a degree of influence
bay financial corp. hurt by high debts and deteriorating real estate investments reported a wider loss for the fourth quarter and said it might be forced to seek a bankruptcy-court reorganization if it ca n't renegotiate its borrowings
bay said a substantial part of its debt outstanding is in default as a result of inability to sell certain properties quickly and lower-than-expected prices for sales made
the company said its real estate portfolio is highly leveraged while about two-thirds of its investments are n't income-producing
thus it is coming up short on a big bet that quick sales at higher prices would enable it to keep up with mortgage and other debt payments
according to its latest annual report about a quarter of the company 's holdings are in massachusetts in the midst of a real-estate slump
the company said it had a net loss in its fourth quarter ended june 30 of $ 36.2 million or $ 9.33 a share on revenue of $ 13.1 million
a year earlier the company had a loss of $ 10.8 million or $ 3.04 a share on revenue of $ 10.8 million
for the year it had a net loss of $ 62 million or $ 15.97 a share on revenue of $ 44.3 million
in the previous year it had a loss of $ 22.5 million or $ 6.52 a share on revenue of $ 41.1 million
although it is having serious cash-flow problems bay said the fair-market value of its holdings minus debt was equal to $ 6.02 a share at june 30 based on a recent appraisal
book value per share which is based on investments at cost was a negative $ 6.69 a share
a year earlier fair-market value per share was $ 26.02 and book value was $ 9.43 a share

trw inc. reported a 12 % decline in third-quarter net income but the company said that excluding unusual gains in both quarters operating profit rose 16 %
the electronics automotive and aerospace concern said third-quarter net was $ 60 million or 98 cents a share down from $ 68 million or $ 1.11 a share a year earlier
share earnings are reported on a fully diluted basis by company tradition
results for the 1988 quarter included a gain of $ 1.05 a share from sale of the reda pump and oilwell cable units partly offset by a charge of 69 cents a share for recall of faulty truck steering systems
the latest quarter included a gain of 11 cents a share as a partial reversal of the recall charge because the reserve established last year exceeded the actual recall costs
sales for the quarter rose 8.3 % to $ 1.79 billion from $ 1.65 billion with all three major product groups reporting gains
the company said aerospace and defense sales were up 2 % for the quarter to $ 802 million and operating profit climbed 6 % to $ 61 million mainly because of improved program performance in spacecraft and advanced-technology contracts
automotive sales jumped 16 % to $ 791 million mainly because of higher sales of air bags and other passenger restraint systems trw said
the group had an operating profit of $ 65 million against a loss of $ 13 million a year earlier
however excluding the year-earlier charge for recall of steering gear operating profit in the latest quarter declined 14 % reflecting higher start-up and product development expenses in passenger-restraint systems
materials and production costs also rose trw said
the information systems segment had a 44 % jump sales to $ 196 million
an acquisition accounted for half the sales rise trw said
operating profit rose threefold to $ 18 million from $ 6 million
for the nine months trw 's net was $ 199 million or $ 3.22 a share down 3 % from $ 205 million or $ 3.33 a share a year earlier
sales rose 2.9 % to $ 5.42 billion from $ 5.27 billion
a tragicomic monologue by an idealistic not unheroic though sadly self-deceived english butler in his sixties proceeds as if the realistic english novel of manners like britannia herself still ruled the waves
in fact kazuo ishiguro 's the remains of the day knopf 245 pages $ 18.95 is both an homage to traditional english forms and a dramatic critique of them
it implies that the british empire was rooted in its subjects ' minds manners and morals and argues tacitly that its self-destructive flaws were embodied in the defensive snobbery willful blindness role-playing and especially the locutions of its domestic servants
as the narrator stevens the solitary butler of darlington hall mulls over such hallowed terms as greatness dignity service and loyalty we see how pious cant subverts the soul
stevens 's dutiful conflation of the public and private realms like his beloved master 's destroys all it was designed to preserve
such armor crushes the soldier
the mask cuts to the quick
it 's 1956 the year the suez crisis marked the final end of empire
as he stands on a hill at the beginning of a six-day motor expedition from oxfordshire to cornwall where a former housekeeper resides perhaps the victim of an unhappy 20-year marriage perhaps he hopes with more fervor than he will ever acknowledge not disinclined to return to domestic service stevens surveys the view and thereby provides a self-portrait a credo and the author 's metaphor for the aesthetic of the novel we 're reading
we call this land of ours great britain and there may be those who believe this a somewhat immodest practice
yet i would venture that the landscape of our country alone would justify the use of this lofty adjective
it is the very lack of obvious drama or spectacle that sets the beauty of our land apart
what is pertinent is the calmness of that beauty its sense of restraint
it is as though the land knows of its own beauty of its own greatness and feels no need to shout it
in comparison the sorts of sights offered in such places as africa and america though undoubtedly very exciting would i am sure strike the objective viewer as inferior on account of their unseemly demonstrativeness
an effusive landscape
an ill-mannered mountain
but let stevens continue in his unwitting comic manner his conscious efforts at banter always fail most comically this whole question is very akin to the question that has caused much debate in our profession over the years what is a great butler
his answer is one possessed of a dignity in keeping with his position
such dignity has to do crucially with a butler 's ability not to abandon the professional being he inhabits
he will not be shaken out by external events however surprising alarming or vexing
continentals are unable to be butlers because they are as a breed incapable of the emotional restraint which only the english race are capable of
despite his racial advantage to be a great butler is a heroic calling one 's pantry is not unlike general 's headquarters during a battle
if for example in the midst of a great social occasion such as an international conference on revising the versailles treaty in 1923 one 's 72-yearold father himself a great butler once should happen to die of a stroke one must continue to serve the port please do n't think me unduly improper in not ascending to see my father in his deceased condition just at this moment
you see i know my father would have wished me to carry on just now
it is this kind of dignity and restraint that allows stevens to declare for all its sad associations whenever i recall that evening today i find i do so with a large sense of triumph
we note the imperial public word used to deny private rage and sorrow
that stevens himself is not grotesque or repellent but funny and sad and enlightening is entirely the author 's triumph
mr. ishiguro 's ability to create a fallible narrative voice that permits him to explore such intertwining domestic cultural and political themes was abundantly clear in his previous novel an artist of the floating world set in japan after the war
now shifting his scene from the country he left at five to the england he has lived in for nearly 30 years he has fashioned a novel in the mode of henry james and e.m. forster
with great aplomb he considers not only filial devotion and utterly repressed sexual love but british anti-semitism the gentry 's impatience with democracy and support of hitler and the moral problematics of loyalty it is in practice simply not possible to adopt such a critical attitude towards an employer and at the same time provide good service
this employer embodies all that i find noble and admirable
i will hereafter devote myself to serving him
this is loyalty intelligently bestowed
in the end after meeting with the former housekeeper stevens sits by the seashore at dusk thinking of her and of his employer and declares i trusted
i trusted in his lordship 's wisdom
i ca n't even say i made my own mistakes
really one has to ask oneself what dignity is there in that
the loyal servant has come full circle
what is greatness
what is dignity
we understand such rueful wisdom must be retrospective the owl of minerva only spreads her wings at dusk
but as the remains of the day so eloquently demonstrates with quiet virtuosity such wisdom can be movingly embodied in art

ugi corp. said its amerigas subsidiary completed the previously announced sale of its air separation plant and related assets in waukesha wis. to aga gas inc. cleveland
the price was n't disclosed
the transaction is part of ugi 's continuing program to shed amerigas 's industrial gas interests and expand the subsidiary 's propane business
since june amerigas has netted more than $ 100 million from industrial gas divestitures and reinvested more than $ 50 million to acquire three propane distributors
ugi is a gas and electric utility and distributes propane nationally through its amerigas subsidiary
stanislav ovcharenko who represents the soviet airline aeroflot here has some visions that are wild even by the current standards of perestroika
in his office overlooking the runway of shannon airport mr. ovcharenko enthusiastically throws out what he calls just ideas
first he suggests gpa group ltd. the international aircraft leasing company based in ireland could lease some of its boeing jetliners to the soviet airline
then aer lingus the irish flag carrier could teach aeroflot pilots to fly the boeings and the fleet could be based here at shannon airport
that 's not all he says
aer rianta the irish airport authority could build a cargo terminal in the soviet union
aeroflot could lease some of its cargo planes to aer lingus through gpa for a joint-venture cargo airline
and then there is his notion of an irish-soviet charter airline to ferry armenians to los angeles via shannon
have the freedoms of glasnost gone to mr. ovcharenko 's head
hardly
the irish-soviet aviation connection is alive and well here at shannon airport
gpa is indeed talking about leasing western planes to aeroflot and even about buying soviet-built tupolev 204s
aer lingus is in discussions with the soviet carrier about a cargo venture and other possibilities
aer rianta already has so many ventures with aeroflot that its chief executive is studying russian
unlikely as it may seem tiny politically neutral ireland has penetrated the mighty soviet airline bureaucracy
and as aeroflot struggles to boost its service standards upgrade its fleet and pursue commercial opportunities the irish aviation industry seems poised to benefit
irish and soviet people are similar says mr. ovcharenko
they look the same
they 're very friendly
moreover he says irish companies are small but spunky
we have to study their experience very well he says
we must find any way to get business
the two groups have been working together since the late 1970s long before soviet joint ventures were the rage in the west
aeroflot carried about 125 million passengers last year and shannon airport the airline 's largest transit airport outside the soviet union saw 1,400 aeroflot flights and 250,000 passengers pass through
an apartment complex down the road is the crew-rest and staging area for more than 130 aeroflot pilots and flight attendants
the airport 's biggest supplier of aircraft fuel is the soviet union
tankers from the latvian port of ventspils each year unload 25 million gallons of fuel into a special tank farm at the airport
what aeroflot does n't pour into its own gas-guzzling ilyushins is bartered to the airport authority which resells it to 11 western carriers including air france trans world airlines and pakistan international airlines
aeroflot thus pays its landing fees ground-handling and catering bills with fuel preserving its hard currency
that is n't all
last year the irish airport authority in a joint venture with aeroflot opened four hard-currency duty-free shops at moscow 's sheremetyevo airport
aer rianta now manages duty-free sales on all aeroflot international flights out of moscow
duty-free shops in leningrad 's pulkova airport opened in july and hard-currency shops in leningrad hotels and on the soviet-finnish frontier are coming soon
aer rianta is talking about similar joint ventures in tashkent and in sochi a black sea resort and even has a computer-assembly project cooking with the georgian city of tbilisi
aeroflot 's international fleet of 285 planes is being repainted and refurbished at shannon airport
thanks to a new air-traffic agreement and the ability of irish travel agents to issue aeroflot tickets tourists here are taking advantage of aeroflot 's reasonable prices to board flights in shannon for holidays in havana kingston and mexico city
the round-trip fare to havana is 410 irish punts $ 578
jamaica costs 504 punts
a formal blessing of sorts was bestowed on this friendship in april when mikhail and raisa gorbachev stopped here for talks with irish prime minister charles haughey
new trade accords were signed
it all started with geography
when it opened in 1939 shannon was the first landfall in europe for thirsty airplanes flying from north america
advances in aircraft fuel efficiency over the years made a shannon stop unnecessary for most western air fleets but aeroflot still flies inefficient ilyushins that ca n't make it from moscow to managua on one hop
as a result ireland did n't spurn the soviets after they shot down a korean air lines jetliner over the sea of japan in 1983 though it suspended direct moscow-shannon flights for two months
in fact aer lingus started ferrying russians from shannon to new york when washington stripped aeroflot of its u.s. landing rights
today aer rianta is making a heap of money from its soviet friendship
and with those contacts in place it could be relatively simple to add aer lingus and gpa to the team
then perhaps mr. ovcharenko 's ideas would n't sound like so much blarney
britain 's industrial production rose 1.5 % in august from july and was up 0.9 % from august 1988 according to provisional data from the central statistical office
output in the energy sector which can vary greatly with swings in the oil market rose 3.8 % in august from may but was down 7.1 % from a year earlier
the latest figures compare with july 's 4.5 % month-to-month rise and 11.3 % year-to-year fall
when nucor corp. begins shipping steel from the world 's first thin-slab plant this month it will begin testing the competitive mettle of its giant competitors
the new technology which creates a very thin piece of steel radically reduces the costs of making flat-rolled sheets
an ebullient kenneth iverson nucor 's chairman says the company 's plant eventually will make a ton of steel in 1.5 man hours compared with four to six man hours at a conventional mill
we 've had the russians and chinese and people from india visiting us mr. iverson beams
everyone in the world is watching us very closely
especially his neighbors the major u.s. steelmakers
already usx corp. and armco inc. are studying nucor 's technology to see if they can adopt it
says the chief executive officer of a major midwest steel company it 's damn worrisome
the once-staid steel industry is about to be turned topsy-turvy by a 1990s technology revolution
new efficient and sophisticated processes make it easier for smaller less cash-rich companies to make steel at a fraction of what big steel paid decades ago
it also enables minimills finally to get a toehold in the flat-rolled steel market the major steelmakers ' largest most prized and until now untouchable market
but such thin-slab technology is only the beginning
eager engineers espouse direct-steelmaking and direct casting which by the end of the 1990s will enable production without coke ovens and blast furnaces
those massive structures while posing cost and environmental headaches effectively locked out all but deep-pocketed giants from steelmaking
there 's a revolution ahead of us that will ultimately change the way we market and distribute steel says william dennis vice president manufacturing and technology for the american iron ore and steel institute
it is n't that major steelmakers have blithely ignored high technology
in fact they 've spent billions of dollars to boost the percentage of continously cast steel to 60.9 % in 1988 from 39.6 % five years before
moreover their balance sheets are rich with diversity their old plants shuttered and work forces lean
but that wo n't suffice
it 's no longer enough to beat the guy down the street
you have to beat everyone around the world says mr. dennis
he wants to see steelmakers more involved in computers and artificial intelligence
the problem they 're saddled with huge plants that require costly maintenance
and try plying new dollars free in a market that is softening hurt by a strong dollar and concerned about overcapacity the industry 's darth vadar
the technology revolution is going to be very threatening to established producers says peter marcus an analyst with painewebber inc
they 've got too much invested in the old stuff and they ca n't get their workers to be flexible
no one expects minimills to eclipse major integrated steelmakers who remain the undisputed kings of highest-quality steel used for autos and refrigerators
nucor 's plant in crawfordsville ind. ultimately will produce only one million tons annually a drop in the 40-million-ton-a-year flat-rolled steel bucket and it will be years before such plants can compete in the high-profit market
still flat-rolled is the steel industry 's bread and butter representing about half of the 80 million tons of steel expected to be shipped this year
moreover the process is n't without its headaches
because all operations are connected one equipment failure forces a complete plant shutdown
on some days the nucor plant does n't produce anything
at this point the minimill capacity wo n't make a great dent in the integrated market but it does challenge them to develop new markets says james mccall vice president materials at battelle a technology and management-research giant based in columbus ohio
indeed with demand for steel not growing fast enough to absorb capacity steelmakers will have to change the way they do business
in the past says armco 's chief economist john corey steelmakers made a product and set it out on the loading dock
we said we 've got a product if you want it you can buy it he says adding now we 're figuring out what people need and are going back to make it
armco 's sales representatives visit the general motors corp. 's fairfax assembly plant in kansas city mo. two or three days a week
when they determined that gm needed parts more quickly armco convinced a steel service center to build a processing plant nearby so shipments could be delivered within 15 minutes
cementing such relationships with major clients car and appliance makers is a means of survival especially when those key clients are relying on a smaller pool of producers and flirting with plastic and aluminum makers
for example when detroit began talking about plastic-bodied cars the american iron and steel institute began a major lobbying effort to show auto makers how they could use steel more efficiently by simply redesigning how a car door is assembled
but steelmakers must also find new markets
after letting aluminum-makers take the recycling lead a group of the nation 's largest steelmakers started a recycling institute to promote steel cans to an environmentally conscious nation
battelle 's mr. mccall thinks steelmakers should concentrate more on construction
weirton steel corp. weirton w. va. for example is touting to homeowners fashionable steel doors with leaded glass inserts as a secure and energy-efficient alternative to wooden or aluminum ones
other steelmakers envision steel roofs covering suburbia
still others are looking at overseas markets
usx is funneling drilling pipe to steel-hungry soviet union
this year the nation 's largest steelmaker reactivated its overseas sales operation
producers also are trying to differentiate by concentrating on higher-profit output such as coated and electrogalvanized products which remain beyond the reach of minimills
almost all capital-improvement programs announced by major steelmakers within the past year involve building electrogalvanizing lines used to produce steel for such products as household appliances and car doors
but unfortunately that segment is much smaller than the bread-and-butter flat-rolled steel
it 's like everyone climbing out of the qe ii and getting into a lifeboat says john jacobson an analyst with aus consultants
after a while someone has to go over the side
although he does n't expect any bankruptcies he does see more plants being sold or closed
robert crandall with the brookings institute agrees
unless there is an enormous rate of economic growth or a further drop in the dollar it 's unlikely that consumption of u.s. produced steel will grow sufficiently to offset the growth of minimills
not to mention the incursion of imports
japanese and european steelmakers which have led the recent technology developments are anxiously awaiting the lifting of trade restraints in 1992
moreover the u.s. can expect more competition from low-cost producing pacific rim and latin american countries
a taiwanese steelmaker recently announced plans to build a nucor-like plant
people think of the steel business as an old and mundane smokestack business says mr. iverson
they 're dead wrong

polaroid corp. 's patent-infringement damages case against eastman kodak co. one of the highest stakes corporate trials ever is getting scant attention on wall street
after 78 days of mind-numbing testimony in federal court in boston the trial is being all but ignored by analysts and patent attorneys
most have read the pre-trial documents however and estimate kodak will be ordered to pay $ 1 billion to $ 1.5 billion for infringing on seven polaroid patents
that may be the largest patent award ever but it is well below the $ 12 billion polaroid seeks
the highest patent damage award to date was in 1986 when smith international inc. was ordered to pay $ 205 million to baker hughes inc. for infringing on a patent on an oil drilling bit seal
the two companies later agreed to settle for $ 95 million
few analysts think it is worth their time to slog through the polaroid trial testimony
it 's like panning for gold outside of grand central station
you might find something but the chances are low said michael ellman an analyst at wertheim schroder & co
and eugene glazer an analyst at dean witter reynolds inc. said if you hired an attorney to be there all the time and give you a prediction of the eventual award i would be willing to bet that he would be off by a lot
a 75-day trial in the early 1980s determined that kodak based in rochester n.y. infringed on patents of polaroid of cambridge mass
the main issues remaining are how to calculate damages and whether the infringement was willful and deliberate
if so the damages could be tripled
two analysts who have read the transcripts david nelson of shearson lehman hutton inc. and calvert d. crary a litigation analyst at labe simpson & co. think judge a. david mazzone will decide in kodak 's favor on the willful and deliberate issue
mr. crary said testimony by kodak 's patent counsel francis t. carr of kenyon & kenyon showed that he worked with kodak continuously from the outset of the project in an effort to avoid infringement
carr told kodak on many occasions to avoid various features because of polaroid 's patent positions and kodak followed his advice in every instance mr. crary said
but irving kayton a patent expert at george mason university school of law who is familiar with the case said the fact that seven patents were infringed suggests that infringement was willful
it 's difficult to be that consistently wrong
observers also wonder whether judge mazzone will use the lost-profits method of determining damages which polaroid favors because it would result in a larger award or the reasonable royalty method
polaroid claims it could have manufactured and sold all the instant cameras and film sold by kodak if kodak had n't entered the market
moreover polaroid contends it could have sold them at a higher price and thus made higher profits because it would n't have been forced to match kodak 's lower prices
each side has called a harvard business school professor to testify on that issue
kodak hired robert buzzell and polaroid brought in robert j. dolan
there 's nothing that says that people at harvard business school have to agree with each other said mr. buzzell
testimony is expected to continue until early december
a decision is n't expected until some time next year
international business machines corp. said earnings tumbled 30 % in the third quarter even a bit further than expected rendering the outlook doubtful for the next few quarters
the main reason was a delay in shipment of new high-end disk drives a business that accounts for some 10 % of ibm 's $ 60 billion of annual revenue
ibm which telegraphed the poor results three weeks ago also cited an increase in its leasing business which tends to lock in business long-term but cut revenue in the near term
in addition ibm noted that the stronger dollar has cut the value of overseas revenue and earnings when they are translated into dollars
earnings fell to $ 877 million or $ 1.51 a share somewhat below securities analysts ' revised expectations of around $ 1.60 a share
that compared with the year-earlier $ 1.25 billion or $ 2.10 a share which was inflated by a 15-cents-a-share gain from the sale of some mci communications corp. stock and by an unspecified amount from a payment by fujitsu ltd. relating to a software dispute
revenue climbed 4.3 % to $ 14.31 billion from $ 13.71 billion
ibm armonk n.y. remained upbeat
the computer giant whose u.s. results have been dismal for years noted that revenue rose again in the u.s. in the third quarter following an increase in the second period
the company said in a statement that demand for ibm products and services continues to be good world-wide
we do not see anything in the fundamentals of our business that would cause us to change our strategy of investing for profitable growth
securities analysts however remained downbeat
i think 1990 will be another mediocre year said steve milunovich of first boston
jay stevens of dean witter actually cut his per-share earnings estimate to $ 9 from $ 9.50 for 1989 and to $ 9.50 from $ 10.35 in 1990 because he decided sales would be even weaker than he had expected
both estimates would mark declines from the 1988 net of $ 5.81 billion or $ 9.80 a share which itself was well below the record ibm set in 1984
mr. stevens said he kept a buy/hold recommendation on the stock only because all the damage has been done
he said the stock has n't traded below 1 1/2 times book value over the past 10 years which at the moment computes to a stock price of $ 100
the stock closed yesterday at $ 103 a share up just $ 1 in composite trading on the new york stock exchange as the market surged
analysts worry that the disk-drive and leasing problems will last at least through the first quarter
a key part of the question is how soon does this disk-drive come and how soon does production ramp up said steve cohen at soundview financial group
and the input i 've had from customers is that it still could be a while
on leasing bob djurdjevic at annex research said he thinks ibm has hurt itself unnecessarily
he said ibm has priced its leases aggressively thinking that would help win business
but he said ibm would have won the business anyway as a sale to a third party that would have then leased the equipment to the customer
he said ibm has not only hurt its short-term revenue outlook but has also been losing money on its leases
bob bardagy executive vice president of marketing at comdisco inc. a huge leasing firm said to put it mildly ibm credit has been doing some of the worst economic deals of any leasing company we have ever seen
ibm is expected to get a boost soon when it announces some new versions of its mainframes
but the basic technology in the line is almost five years old which means it is long in the tooth and competitors are rolling out strong products of their own
ibm is gaining momentum in the personal-computer market and is expected to introduce some impressive workstations early next year
but it 's hard to squeeze much profit out of the personal-computer business these days and the workstation market while important is too small to rely on for much growth
the disk drives will doubtless sell well when they finally become available
but the as/400 ibm 's highly successful minicomputer line is losing its momentum and some analysts said sales could even decline in the fourth quarter
in addition ibm 's growth in software in the third quarter was just 8.8 % well below historical levels even when adjusted to reflect last year 's payment from fujitsu and the stronger dollar
and expenses up 7.9 % in the quarter have stayed stubbornly high
in the nine months ibm earned $ 3.17 billion or $ 5.43 a share down 8.4 % from the year-earlier $ 3.46 billion or $ 5.83 a share
revenue increased 6.5 % to $ 42.25 billion from $ 39.68 billion
pepsico inc. 's chairman said he is more than comfortable with analysts ' estimates that third-quarter earnings rose to at least 98 cents to $ 1 a share from 91 cents the year earlier
d. wayne calloway also chief executive officer of the company indicated that he expects analysts to raise their forecasts for 1989 after the company releases its earnings today
so far analysts have said they are looking for $ 3.30 to $ 3.35 a share
after today 's announcement that range could increase to $ 3.35 to $ 3.40 a share
the official said he also would be comfortable with that new range
in 1988 the soft-drink giant earned $ 2.90 a share
results for 1989 will include about 40 cents a share from the dilutive effects of snack-food and bottling company acquisitions
in composite trading on the new york stock exchange the company closed yesterday at $ 57.125 a share up $ 3.125
the company said third-quarter sales are expected to increase 25 % from $ 3.12 billion of last year 's third quarter
domestic soft-drink bottler case sales are estimated to have risen only 1 % in the third quarter well below the 4 % to 5 % growth of recent years but about in line with the rest of the soft-drink industry
mr. calloway blamed the slower volume on rainier weather a dearth of new products in the industry and to a much lesser extent pricing
pepsico said its soft-drink prices were about 2 % higher in the quarter
mr. calloway also noted that soft-drink volume rose a hefty 9 % in last year 's third quarter making the comparison more difficult
international soft-drink volume was up about 6 %
snack-food tonnage increased a strong 7 % in the third quarter while domestic profit increased in double digits mr. calloway said
excluding the british snack-food business acquired in july snack-food international tonnage jumped 40 % with sales strong in spain mexico and brazil
total snack-food profit rose 30 %
led by pizza hut and taco bell restaurant earnings increased about 25 % in the third quarter on a 22 % sales increase
same-store sales for pizza hut rose about 13 % while taco bell 's increased 22 % as the chain continues to benefit from its price-value strategy
taco bell has turned around declining customer counts by permanently lowering the price of its tacos
same store-sales for kentucky fried chicken which has struggled with increased competition in the fast-food chicken market and a lack of new products rose only 1 %
the operation which has been slow to respond to consumers ' shifting tastes away from fried foods has been developing a grilled-chicken product that may be introduced nationally at the end of next year
the new product has performed well in a market test in las vegas nev. mr. calloway said
after a four-year $ 7.7 billion acquisition binge that brought a major soft-drink company soda bottlers a fast-food chain and an overseas snack-food giant to pepsi mr. calloway said he does n't expect any major acquisition in the next year or so
but you never can tell he added you have to take advantage of opportunities
president bush chose martin allday a longtime friend from texas to be chairman of the federal energy regulatory commission
mr. allday would succeed martha hesse who is resigning
the white house said ms. hesse a chicago businesswoman who previously held posts at the energy department and ferc is leaving to become a vice president of first chicago corp
mr. allday an attorney in midland texas has been solicitor at the interior department
he met mr. bush in the 1950s when the president was a young oil man in midland and mr. allday was a lawyer for an oil firm
the ferc is a five-member commission that regulates billions of dollars of interstate wholesale energy transactions
mr. allday 's appointment is subject to confirmation by the senate
administration officials said a date for ms. hesse 's departure has n't been set
california real estate investment corp. said its directors declared a dividend of five cents per class a common stock payable nov. 6 to stock of record oct. 16
the dividend represents the balance of its regular quarterly payout of 10 cents a share of which half was paid july 17 in a final distribution prior to its merger with b.b. real estate investment corp. also in july
the company said it hopes to resume its schedule of regular quarterly dividends at the end of this year
hydro-quebec said it notified central maine power co. it will cancel a $ 4 billion contract to supply electricity to the maine utility
the provincially owned utility said it is tearing up the deal because the contract 's objectives ca n't be fulfilled
hydro-quebec said maine regulators ' refusal to approve the contract earlier this year halted work on transmission lines and stopped negotiations for resale of electricity carried through maine to other utilities
it would now be physically impossible to begin deliveries in 1992 a hydro-quebec official said
the contract was to run from 1992 to 2020
under the contract hydro-quebec was to supply 400 megawatts of power to central maine power starting in 1992 600 megawatts starting in 1995 and 900 megawatts starting in
hydro-quebec said maine regulators ' refusal to approve the contract means central maine power has lost its place in line
we wo n't sign any new contracts with deliveries beginning earlier than 2000 the hydro-quebec official said
he said hydro-quebec already has some customers in mind for the power that was to be delivered to maine
nothing has happened since we signed the contract to undermine our conviction that hydro-quebec was the lowest-cost most environmentally acceptable choice for meeting a part of our customers ' energy needs through the year 2020 said central maine senior vice president donald f. kelly
central maine said it is evaluating many energy options to make up for the lost future power including new energy generation and management proposals from new england and possibly new canadian purchases
chicago options traders were among the big victims of friday 's plunging stock market including one small firm that required an emergency $ 50 million bailout
while monday 's rebounding markets helped other investors recoup losses many options customers and professional traders in stock-index options and the options on takeover stocks were left with multimillion-dollar losses traders here and in new york said
options traders were hurt worse than others on friday because of the highly volatile nature of options which often rise or fall in value several times the amount of the price change in the individual stock or index of stocks on which they are based
thus options traders friday were stuck with losses that also were several times larger than those suffered by many stock traders in new york
jeffrey miller of miller tabak hirsch & co. said that given the high degree of leverage in the options market it is very easy for these guys to get wiped out
that may just be the nature of these highly leveraged little creatures
an options contract gives the holder the right to buy call or sell put a specific amount of stock or in this case the value of a stock index based on a predetermined price within a given time period
options traders who in return for a small fee or premium had previously sold put options on stocks or stock indexes were forced on friday to buy those contracts back at the previously agreed prices which were substantially above those in the market as it was falling
they then had no choice in many cases but to sell the contracts at prevailing prices in most cases at a substantial loss
the latest round of losses is likely to be a serious blow to the chicago board options exchange which has never fully recovered from the aftershock of black monday when investors fled the market because of huge losses
making matters worse was the fact that late friday afternoon the cboe halted stock-index options trading in step with the chicago mercantile exchange 's halt in stock-index futures
but while the merc reopened a half hour later the cboe remained closed leaving many options traders unable to make trades that might have reduced the losses
cboe chairman alger duke chapman said that unlike the futures market the options exchange has to open in a rotation that allows each different options series to trade
exchange officials reasoned that they would n't have been able to make such a rotation with the time remaining friday afternoon and with the stock-index futures on the verge of closing for a second and final time the cboe reasoned that its best course was to remain closed
the damage was so bad at fossett corp. an options trading firm here that it was forced to transfer its accounts to first options of chicago a unit of continental bank corp. as a result of options trading losses
fosset so far is the only member of a financial exchange to be forced to be taken over by another firm as a result of friday 's rout
fossett still had several million dollars in capital left after friday 's close of trading but not enough that regulators worried about another potential market plunge yesterday would let it reopen for trading options exchange officials said
thus in an unprecedented arrangement underscoring the seriousness of the transfer the cboe the american stock exchange and the options clearing corp. as well as the firm 's owner stephen fossett put up a total of $ 50 million to guarantee the customer positions being transferred to the bank holding company subsidiary in case the market plunged again yesterday
s. waite rawls iii vice chairman of continental bank first options ' parent company said the firm took on about 160 accounts formerly held by fossett almost all of them belonging to professional floor traders
steve and his firm were still worth a lot of money mr. rawls said
a package of credit support was put together including the assets of steve and his firm
the bailout was cobbled together over the weekend with officials from the federal reserve board securities and exchange commission comptroller of the currency and treasury as well as the options exchanges
it was great to have the luxury of time mr. rawls said
at one point an options industry official had to talk the federal reserve bank of chicago 's night watchman into giving him the home phone number of silas keene chicago fed president
first options did n't have to put any money into the bailout
yesterday 's rally in the stock futures and options markets led cboe and amex officials to conclude that the $ 50 million in guarantees almost certainly wo n't need to be tapped by first options
the fossett firm had some losses and liquidity problems during the october 1987 crash as well mr. rawls said
a federal official said that continental bank worked with securities and banking regulators over the weekend to fashion the fossett bailout but that conditions were n't dictated by those agencies
it was their business decision the official said
officials at options clearing corp. which processes all options trades for u.s. exchanges said that the $ 50 million guarantee was unprecedented but was necessary to help insure the integrity of the options markets
it was an extraordinary situation that needed extraordinary steps said paul stevens occ president and chief operating officer
mr. stevens declined to give the specific contributions to the $ 50 million guarantee from each participant
but cboe and amex officials said that options clearing corp. contributed $ 20 million to the guarantee the cboe put up $ 8 million the amex added $ 4 million and $ 18 million came from mr. fossett 's own assets
mr. fossett could n't be reached to comment
debora foster takes off her necklace settles herself on a padded chair and gently leans forward
with a jazz-piano tape playing softly in the background the soothing hands of sabina vidunas begin to work on ms. foster 's neck and shoulders
it 's like an oasis in this room ms. foster purrs
the room in question is the directors ' lounge of h.j. heinz co. 60 floors above the bustle of pittsburgh
there amid oil paintings and marble tables massages are administered every wednesday
on days that i 'm really busy says ms. foster who works in public relations for the company it seems decadent to take time off for a massage
although such sessions may never replace coffee breaks on-site massage as it is known in the trade is certainly infiltrating corporate america
in some companies middle managers sneak massage therapists into the office fearful that upper-level executives wo n't approve
ms. foster 's indulgence is nothing like the oily hour-long rubfests enjoyed by spa visitors
nor does it at all resemble despite what some executives think the more intimate variety offered at specialty parlors in bad parts of town
on the contrary office rubdowns usually take place in dimly lighted conference rooms where stressed-out employees relax in specially designed chairs fully clothed
the massages last 15 minutes and typically cost about $ 10
some companies including heinz even pay part of the fee
ms. vidunas has been seeing some 15 clients a visit since the program was started at heinz last year
anthony j.f. o'reilly the company 's chairman swears by her firm touch saying regular massages are a balm for his old football injuries
massage advocates say that kneading the head shoulders neck and back can go a long way toward easing tension and improving morale
they also insist that touching is a basic need as powerful as the need for food or sleep and that the office is as good a place as any to do it
the blood flows to your head you feel lightheaded and you do n't feel tension around the head or neck says minnie morey an operations supervisor at the social security office in grand rapids mich. where massages began last month
when you leave the room after your massage people say you look like you 're glowing
adds candice ohlman the 35-year-old masseuse who plies her trade in the grand rapids office they fall in love with my hands
not everyone however is at ease with office massage
three years ago the internal revenue service 's office in san jose calif. opened its doors to on-site massage
and even though employees paid the bill taxpayers grumbled
sometimes with the release of stress you hear oohs ' and ahs ' coming out of the room explains morgan banks the agency 's health specialist
and you ca n't have taxpayers coming into an audit hearing oohs ' and ahs
last month the complaints intensified and the massages ended
now we 're looking for a room with thicker walls ms. banks says
massage also has an image problem to contend with
some masseurs have tried to get around this by calling themselves bodyworkers and describing their office visits as reinvigoration breaks
but massage no matter how chaste is still associated in many minds with seedy fronts for prostitution and that makes some executives nervous
last year the research and development division of weyerhaeuser co. the large wood-products concern invited a masseuse to its tacoma wash. offices
phil harms a software engineer was an eager customer
you build up a lot of tension working at a terminal all day he says
but after about eight months the vice president of the division ed soule learned about the sessions and brought them to a halt
mr. soule says his only beef was that the massages were being given in a company conference room the department 's supervised health facility would have been fine
in my view massages should be managed with an appropriate mixture of males and females around he says
given such attitudes some corporate masseurs prefer to go about their business quietly
russell borner of park ridge n.j. says he has been working for the past year at a huge chemical and manufacturing concern in new york unbeknownst to the company 's executives
he visits the same department every two or three weeks
his massage chair is kept in a closet and a secretary escorts him past security
this is common with a lot of large companies says mr. borner who worked for american telephone & telegraph co. for 23 years before choosing his current trade
managers he contends are afraid how they 're going to look in the eyes of their peers
my vision is to change human consciousness towards touch
my attitude is let 's come out of the closet
occasionally all that 's needed is a little coaxing
elisa byler a st. louis masseuse won over officials at emerson electric co. a maker of electrical and electronic equipment by providing documents and other articles trumpeting the therapeutic benefits of massage
she notes that she also stresses professionalism during her weekly visits
i pull my hair back wear a little makeup and look corporate says ms. byler who has been visiting emerson since january
if i go in there as i normally dress they 'd ask who is this hippie
the self-proclaimed father of on-site massage is david palmer a 41-year-old san francisco masseur whose mission is to save the touch-starved masses
to help do this mr. palmer developed a portable massage chair three years ago that he hopes will bring structured touching into mainstream america
the culture is not ready to take off its clothes lie down and be touched for an hour for $ 45 he says
the idea is to keep the clothes on and to keep people seated
the chair is a way to package massage
sitting in one of mr. palmer 's chairs which cost $ 425 and have since been copied by others is a bit like straddling a recliner
customers lean forward rest their knees on side supports and bury their face in padding on the back of the chair
ms. ohlman the grand rapids masseuse says she has heard the odd-looking contraption compared to something out of the spanish inquisition
mr. palmer who serves as president of the on-site massage association and writes an industry newsletter says some 4,000 practitioners out of about 50,000 certified masseurs across the country now use massage chairs in the workplace as well as on street corners in airports and malls and at conventions and other gatherings where weary people can be found
scot macinnis a masseur in boulder colo. had a scary experience while massaging a man in a natural-foods supermarket as part of a store promotion
three minutes into the massage the man curled up began shaking and turned red
paramedics were called
a week later the man told mr. macinnis he had suffered a mild heart attack unrelated to the massage
it was a powerful point in my career says the 31-year-old mr. macinnis who has since taken out a $ 1 million liability policy for his business
but he pulled through and after the ambulance left there were still six people in line waiting for a massage
the next woman was older and i was afraid to touch her
but it 's like falling off a horse and getting back on
despite the number of fans that office massage has won some purists look down on it arguing that naked full-body rubs are the only way to go
linda aldridge who does full-body work in pittsburgh says that while on-site massage is better than nothing tired workers should realize it is only the tip of the iceberg
whole areas of their bodies are neglected she says adding that clothes ruin the experience
there 's nothing like skin to skin
in what is believed to be the first cancellation of a loan to china since the june 4 killings in beijing an international bank syndicate has terminated a $ 55 million credit for a shanghai property project
the syndicate led by schroders asia ltd. agreed last november to provide the loan to asia development corp. a u.s. property developer
but several weeks ago in the wake of the beijing killings the loan was canceled according to bankers and executives close to the project
asia development and schroders declined to comment on the move
lenders had doubts about the project even before june 4 but the harsh crackdown which caused many businesses to reassess their china transactions gave the banks the out they wanted says an official close to the shanghai venture
the decision to cancel the loan exemplifies the tough attitude bankers have taken toward china since june 4
while some commercial lending has resumed international lenders remain nervous about china 's economic troubles and foreign debt $ 40 billion at the end of 1988
many loans are being renegotiated especially those tied to the hotel sector which has been hit hard by a post-june 4 tourism slump
many bankers view property-sector loans as particularly risky
the canceled shanghai loan leaves asia development a small concern saddled with a half-completed 32-story apartment building and heavy debts
the company owes $ 11 million to the shui on group the project 's hong kong contractor and a significant though unspecified amount in legal fees to coudert brothers a u.s. law firm the sources say
the project known as lotus mansion has been mired in controversy
when the loan agreement was announced it was hailed as one of the first western-style financing transactions ever used in china
unlike most loans to china there was no chinese guarantor
instead the banks secured a promise from state-owned bank of communications that it would lend asia development the entire $ 55 million at maturity to finance repayment of the original borrowing
the loan was to have matured in just two to three years as soon as construction was completed
but in a letter sent in august to asia development schroders said the loan was terminated because the developer had failed to deliver adequate financial data and pay certain fees to the loan-management committee on time according to officials close to the project
creditors involved in the project contend however that the termination actually had nothing to do with these technical violations
instead the creditors say the loan fell victim to nervousness about china 's political turmoil as well as to concern about the loan 's security
the bank syndicate is made up mostly of european banks but it includes china 's state-owned citic industrial bank
the 11 banks in the syndicate sustained no monetary losses because none of the credit facility had been drawn down
k mart corp. agreed to acquire pace membership warehouse inc. for $ 23 a share or $ 322 million in a move to expand its presence in the rapidly growing warehouse-club business
the proposed merger comes as k mart 's profit is declining and sales at its core discount stores are rising more slowly than at such competitors as wal-mart stores inc
k mart based in troy mich. recently said net income would fall for the third consecutive quarter after a 16 % drop in the first half of its current fiscal year
the membership warehouse-club concept has great potential the company 's chairman joseph e. antonini said in a statement
warehouse clubs typically carry general merchandise and food products which they sell for close to wholesale prices in no-frills stores
shoppers many of whom operate small businesses pay annual membership fees which provide an income base for the stores
k mart tested the warehouse-club sector last year with its acquisition of a 51 % interest in makro inc
but the makro chain which operates as a joint venture between k mart and shv holdings n.v. of the netherlands has only six stores and annual sales that one analyst estimated at about $ 300 million
six-year-old pace based in aurora colo. operates 41 warehouse-club stores
the company had losses for several years before turning profitable in fiscal 1988
in the year ended jan. 31 pace rang up profit of $ 9.4 million or 72 cents a share after a tax-loss carry-forward on sales of $ 1.3 billion and analysts expect its results to continue to improve
the company turned the corner fairly recently in profitability said margo mcglade of painewebber inc. who had been forecasting a 46 % jump in pace 's net income from operations this year and another 42 % increase next year
warehouse productivity is really beginning to take off
but some analysts contend k mart has agreed to pay too much for pace
even if you look at it as a turnaround situation it 's expensive said wayne hood of prudential-bache securities inc
in my opinion you would only pay that kind of price if you were getting a premier player in the industry
ms. mcglade of painewebber raised a more fundamental question about the deal
if k mart ca n't get its act together in discounting why is it spending time worrying about other growing markets
she said i would say k mart 's number one job is to address its market-share loss in discount stores which longer-term will lead to improved profit margins
at that point perhaps diversification would be appropriate
but k mart 's mr. antonini is intent on pushing the company into new retail businesses
for instance k mart is opening big food and general merchandise stores called hypermarkets and warehouse-type stores specializing in office products and sporting goods
it also operates waldenbooks pay less drug stores and builders square home improvement stores
in composite trading on the new york stock exchange k mart closed yesterday at $ 36 a share up 12.5 cents
pace rose $ 2.625 to close at $ 22.125 a share in national over-the-counter trading
a k mart spokesman said the acquisition would be financed with short-term borrowings
under terms of the agreement a k mart subsidiary will soon make a tender offer for pace shares
among the conditions of the offer is that pace shareholders tender a majority of the company 's shares outstanding
the companies said pace would ill continue to operate under its present management

traders nervously watching their quotron electronic-data machines yesterday morning were stunned to see the dow jones industrial average plummet 99 points in seconds
a minute later it soared 128 points then zoomed back down 113 points 69 below friday 's close
it was crazy said neil weisman general partner of chilmark capital corp
it was like flying without a pilot in the front of the plane
but those who said this ca n't be happening were right
the quotrons were wrong
quotron systems inc. a citicorp unit blamed the 30-minute foul-up on a timing problem in our software caused by the enormous early volume about 145 million shares in the first hour of new york stock exchange trading
the prices of the individual stocks that make up the average were correct quotron said but the average was wrong
meanwhile there was an awful lot of confusion
at about 10:40 a.m. on the over-the-counter trading desk at a major brokerage firm a veteran trader who buys and sells some of the most active stocks looked at a senior official and asked what 's going on
is the market up or down
at the time quotron was reporting that the industrial average was down 70 points
in fact it was up 24
holly stark a vice president who heads the trading desk at dillon read capital corp. said that once she figured out the quotron numbers were wrong she called brokers to tell them
it 's been kind of annoying to say the least she said
to confuse matters further when ual corp. stock finally opened on the new york stock exchange at 11:08 a.m. the price was listed at $ 324.75 a share up about $ 45 from friday in fact its true price was $ 224.75 down $ 55
that was the new york stock exchange 's blooper
a spokesman cited a technical error and declined to elaborate
and there were other blunders
when the market opened at 9:30 a.m. est a reporter for the reuters newswire miscalculated the industrial average 's drop as a 4 % decline when it really was down 0.7 %
it was a case of human error which we found almost immediately and corrected a spokesman for reuter in new york said
meanwhile some currency traders at west german banks in frankfurt said they sold dollars on the news and had to buy them back later at higher prices
but it was the quotron problems that had lingering effects
dillon read 's ms. stark said in early afternoon that she was still viewing prices and other data as subject to verification and she said portfolio managers continued to question the numbers they saw on the screen
it was the second time in less than a week that quotron has had problems calculating the industrial average
at the start of trading last wednesday the average appeared to plunge more than 200 points
actually it was down only a few points at the time
quotron said that snafu which lasted nine minutes resulted from a failure to adjust for a 4-for-1 stock split at philip morris cos
a quotron spokeswoman said recent software changes may have contributed to yesterday 's problems
she said quotron switched to a backup system until the problems were corrected
today of all days she lamented
the eyes of the world were watching us

houston attorney dale friend representing a plaintiff in a damage suit says he has negotiated a settlement that will strike a blow for his client
literally
it turns out mr. friend 's client machelle parks of cincinnati did n't like the way defense attorney tom alexander acted during the legal proceedings
so she has agreed to forgo monetary damages against mr. alexander 's client in return for the right to punch the attorney
ms. parks 's mother also gets to cuff mr. alexander
so does mr. friend and his law partner nick nichols
the bizarre arrangement grows out of mr. alexander 's representation of derr construction co. one of several defendants in a wrongful death lawsuit brought by ms. parks the widow of a construction worker killed in january 1987 while working on a new houston convention center
last month mr. friend says mr. alexander 's associate agreed that derr would pay $ 50,000 as part of an overall settlement
but mr. alexander scuttled the deal at the last minute angering the plaintiff 's side
i never agreed to it mr. alexander says adding that it 's not necessary to pay these nuisance settlements
when ms. parks and her mother heard about what had happened mr. friend says they volunteered that they would like to give mr. alexander a good walloping
mr. friend says he passed that along to his adversary and soon they were talking about the ground rules under which derr could keep its money and the plaintiffs could take a shot at mr. alexander
although time and place have yet to be determined some details are in place
mr. friend says he agreed to strike mr. alexander above the belt
ms. parks and her mother indicated they want to catch him unawares from behind he says
mr. alexander for his part insisted that the punchers ca n't assign their pummeling rights to anyone else ca n't use a blunt instrument and ca n't take a running start
mr. alexander says he regards the agreement which has n't been submitted to a judge as something of a joke
however he acknowledges they have the option of taking a swat at me if they really want to
mr. friend says his side is dead serious
although they do n't contemplate delivering any disabling blows he says that mr. alexander will be asked to sign a release from liability just in case
after two years of drought it rained money in the stock-index futures markets yesterday
as financial markets rebounded trading volume in the chicago mercantile exchange 's huge standard & poor 's 500 stock-index futures pit soared reaching near-record levels for the first time since october 1987
the sudden influx of liquidity enabled several traders to reap six-figure windfalls in a matter of minutes as prices soared traders said
guys were minting money in there today said john legittino a futures broker for elders futures inc. in chicago
the s&p 500 futures contract which moves in fractions of an index point under normal conditions jumped two to three points in seconds early yesterday after an initial downturn then moved strongly higher the rest of the day
each index point represents a $ 500 profit for each s&p 500 contract held
for the first time since the 1987 crash traders said that they were able to trade several hundred s&p 500 contracts at a time in a highly liquid market
many institutions and individual investors have shied away from stock-index futures blaming them for speeding the stock market crash on black monday two years ago
since the crash many futures traders have n't assumed large positions for fear that the s&p 500 market with much of its customer order flow missing would dry up if prices turned against them
more than 400 traders jammed the s&p 500 futures pit to await the opening bell
traders were shouting bids and offers a full five minutes before the start of trading at 8:30 am
the contract fell five points at the open to 323.85 the maximum opening move allowed under safeguards adopted by the merc to stem a market slide
but several traders quickly stepped up and bid for contracts driving prices sharply higher
the market hovered near friday 's closing price of 328.85 for about a half hour moving several index points higher or lower in seconds then broke higher and did n't look back
the s&p 500 contract that expires in december closed up a record 15.65 points on volume of nearly 80,000 contracts
traders five feet from each other were making bids and offers that were a full point apart said one s&p 500 broker
you could buy at the bid and sell at the offer and make a fortune he marveled
several of wall street 's largest securities firms including salomon brothers inc. and painewebber inc. were also large buyers traders said
salomon brothers was among the largest sellers of stock-index futures last week traders said
brokerage firms as a rule do n't comment on their market activity
unlike the week following black monday two years ago individual traders in the s&p 500 pit were also being uncharacteristically circumspect about their one-day profits
with the fbi around here bragging rights are a thing of the past said one trader referring to the federal investigation of futures trading that so far has resulted in 46 indictments lodged against individuals on the merc and the chicago board of trade
the market for $ 200 billion of high-yield junk bonds regained some of its footing as the dow jones industrial average rebounded from friday 's plunge
but the junk recovery led by the bellwether rjr holdings bonds was precarious
no trading existed for the vast majority of junk bonds securities industry officials said
on friday trading in practically every issue ground to a halt as potential buyers fled and brokerage firms were unwilling to provide bid and offer prices for most issues
nothing traded on friday and people were n't really sure where the market should have opened yesterday said raymond minella co-head of merchant banking at merrill lynch & co
but we had a fairly active day yesterday
at drexel burnham lambert inc. the leading underwriter of junk bonds i was prepared to be in a very bad mood tonight said david feinman a junk bond trader
now i feel maybe there 's a little bit of euphoria
but before the stock market rebounded from a sharp early sell-off yesterday he said you could n't buy junk bonds and you could n't give them away
yesterday 's rally was led by rjr holdings 13 3/4 % bonds which initially tumbled three points or $ 30 for each $ 1,000 face amount to 96 1/4 before rebounding to 99 3/4
bonds issued by kroger duracell safeway and american standard also showed big gains recovering almost all their losses from friday and early yesterday
but traders said the junk bond market increasingly is separating into a top-tier group in which trades can be executed easily and a larger group of lower-quality bonds in which liquidity or the ability to trade without too much difficulty has steadily deteriorated this year
liquidity has n't returned to the vast middle ground of the market said mr. minella of merrill
the deadbeats are still deadbeats said mr. feinman of drexel
analysts are concerned that much of the high-yield market will remain treacherous for investors
paul asquith associate professor at the massachusetts institute of technology 's sloan school of management citing a pattern of junk-bond default rates that are low in the early years after issuance and rise later says we 're now in a period where we 're starting to see defaults from the big issue years of 1984 to 1986
mark bachmann a senior vice president at standard & poor 's corp. confirms that there is increasing concern about the future liquidity of the junk bond market
junk bonds are a highly stratified market said lewis glucksman vice chairman of smith barney harris upham & co
there 's a whole bunch of stuff that 's money good and a whole bunch of stuff that 's not so good
analysts at standard & poor 's say junk bond offerings by tightly stretched issuers seem to be growing
almost $ 8 billion of junk bonds that are considered untradeable include issues from sci tv gillette holdings not related to gillette co. interco seaman furniture allied stores federated department stores national gypsum m.d.c. holdings micropolis leaseway transportation and price communications
you could still have some very bad times ahead said mr. bachmann
it 's possible to have a 10 % default rate in one year because we 're already seeing big problems in the midst of a pretty strong economy
i 'm certainly not comfortable saying we 've seen the bottom
but yesterday 's rally among good junk was a badly needed tonic for the market
many issues bounced off the floor mr. minella said and benchmark junk issues recovered all of their losses from friday and early yesterday
in contrast he says the stock market gained back only about half what it lost friday and the government bond market lost about half what it gained friday
traders said yesterday 's rally was fueled by insurance companies looking for bargains after a drastic slide in prices the past month
in addition mutual funds did n't appear to be major sellers of high-yield securities as was expected
sometimes a shakeout is healthy said drexel 's mr. feinman
people will learn to be more circumspect
if they do good credit analysis they will avoid the hand grenades
i think the market is in good shape
should you really own stocks
that 's a question a lot of people are asking following the stock market 's stunning display of volatility
whipsawed financially and emotionally by friday 's heartstopping 190-point drop in the dow jones industrial average and yesterday 's 88-point rebound they 're wondering if an individual has any business being in the market
the answer say academic researchers money managers and investment specialists is yes as long as you approach the stock market as an investor
but they say people should n't try to be traders who buy and sell in an effort to ride the latest economic trend or catch the next hot stock
the case for owning stocks over the long-term is compelling
if you look at 75 years worth of investment history including the great depression and every bear market since stocks have outperformed almost everything an individual could have owned by a long shot says barry berlin vice president at first wachovia capital management
a dollar invested in the stock market in 1926 would have grown to $ 473.29 by the end of last june according to laurence siegel managing director at ibbotson associates inc
but a dollar invested in long-term bonds in 1926 would have grown to only $ 16.56 and a dollar put in treasury bills would equal a meager $ 9.29
the longer the time period the less risk there is of losing money in the stock market
over time the odds increasingly favor the investor with a diversified portfolio
for instance ken gregory a san francisco money manager calculates that if an investor holds a basket of stocks that tracks the standard & poor 's 500-stock index the chance of losing money is 3 % to 4 % over a 10-year period compared with 15 % over three years and 30 % over one year
if you do n't need the money for 10 years there 's a clear-cut case for sticking to a steady core of stocks mr. gregory says
stock-market investments also help balance the other assets an individual owns says john blankenship jr. president of the institute of certified financial planners
stocks have a place in an investors ' portfolio along with real estate bonds international securities and cash he says
there are some important caveats before investing in stocks individuals should have at least three to six months of living expenses set aside in the bank most investment advisers say
individuals also should focus on building equity in a home which provides some protection against inflation as well as a nest-egg that can be cashed in late in life to help cover the cost of retirement living
people also should n't invest money in stocks that they 'll need in the near future for example for college tuition payments or retirement expenses
you may have to sell your stocks at a time when the market takes a plunge says mr. blankenship a del mar calif. financial planner
but once the basics are covered then i would start to invest even if it 's as little as $ 1,000 says michael lipper president of lipper analytical services inc
he says individuals should consider not just stocks but other long-term investments such as high-quality bonds
despite the strong case for stocks however most pros warn that individuals should n't try to profit from short-term developments
it 's very difficult to do says donald holt a market strategist for wedbush morgan securities a los angeles brokerage firm
our markets move so fast and they are so volatile there 's no way the average investor can compete with the pros
individual investors face high transaction costs of moving in and out of the market
the cost of executing stock orders varies from brokerage to brokerage and with the size of the order but 2 % of the order 's value is an average says stephen boesel manager of t. rowe price 's growth and income mutual fund
and assuming their first investment is successful investors will have to pay taxes on their gains
that can reduce returns by a third or more once local taxes are included mr. lipper says
after that individual traders face the risk that the new investment they choose wo n't perform well so their trading costs could be sustained for nothing
it 's very tough for most individuals to out-trade the mutual funds or the market says mr. lipper
you should really think twice if you think you can out-smart the system
then too many individual investors lack the sturdy emotional makeup professionals say is needed to plunge in and out of the market
so what 's the best way to buy stocks
unless an individual has a minimum of between $ 50,000 and $ 100,000 to invest in stocks he 's still better off in mutual funds than in individual stocks in terms of getting enough attention from a competent broker says mr. lipper
still he adds i could see owning both given that individuals often have an advantage over big investors in spotting special situations based on their own insights he adds
george douglas first vice president at drexel burnham lambert inc. says that individuals have a particular edge now in small to medium-size niche companies with exciting earnings prospects a traditional stomping ground for small investors
this growth sector which usually carries a price/earnings multiple about twice that of the standard & poor 's 500 happens to include some of the market 's most attractive bargains right now
it 's now selling at a multiple about even with the market says mr. douglas
moreover mr. douglas sees a revival of institutional interest in smaller growth stocks that could boost the performance of these stocks in the medium term
many big wall street brokerage firms who eliminated their research effort in stocks of emerging growth companies a few years ago are now resuming coverage of this area he notes
we 're seeing a real turnaround in interest in small growth stocks he says
the pros strenuously advise individuals to stay away from the latest investment fad
they say that 's especially important this late in the growth phase of the economic cycle when there 's no robust bull market to bail investors out of their mistakes
friday 's correction presents a pretty good buying opportunity but let 's not speculate at this point in the business cycle says carmine grigoli chief equity portfolio strategist at first boston corp
buy stocks on weakness for their long-term fundamentals he says
in the long run investment advisers say most investors will be better off using the dollar-cost averaging method of buying stocks
in this method a person invests a regular amount every month or quarter into the stock market whether the market is up or down
that cuts the risk mr. gregory the san francisco money manager points out
when the market is low you are buying more shares and when it 's high you 're buying fewer shares he says
otherwise if you put all your money in at one time by sheer bad luck you might pick a terrible time and have to wait three years to get even mr. gregory says
a disciplined program will work the best mr. boesel says
one of the hardest things to do is to buy stocks when the market is down he says
but that 's just the time when you should be buying them

donald trump who faced rising doubt about his bid for american airlines parent amr corp. even before a united airlines buy-out came apart friday withdrew his $ 7.54 billion offer
separately bankers representing the group trying to buy united 's parent ual corp. met with other banks about reviving that purchase at a lower price possibly around $ 250 a share or $ 5.65 billion
but a lower bid could face rejection by the ual board
mr. trump who vowed wednesday to go forward with the bid said he was dropping it in light of the recent change in market conditions
he said he might now sell his amr stake buy more shares or make another offer at a lower price
the manhattan real-estate developer acted after the ual buyers failed to obtain financing for their earlier $ 300-a-share bid which sparked a selling panic among that snowballed into a 190-point drop friday in the dow jones industrial average
news about ual and amr whose shares never reopened after trading was halted friday for the ual announcement sent both stocks nosediving in composite trading on the new york stock exchange
ual tumbled $ 56.875 to $ 222.875 on volume of 2.3 million shares and amr declined by $ 22.125 to $ 76.50 as 4.7 million shares changed hands
together the two stocks wreaked havoc among takeover stock traders and caused a 7.3 % drop in the dow jones transportation average second in size only to the stock-market crash of oct. 19 1987
some said friday 's market debacle had given mr. trump an excuse to bail out of an offer that showed signs of stalling even before problems emerged with the ual deal
after reaching an intraday high of $ 107.50 the day mr. trump disclosed his bid oct. 5 amr 's stock had retreated as low as $ 97.75 last week
some takeover stock traders had been betting against mr. trump because he has a record of disclosing stakes in companies that are potential takeover targets then selling at a profit without making a bid
he still has n't proven his mettle as a big-league take-out artist said airline analyst kevin murphy of morgan stanley & co
he 's done this thing where he 'll buy a little bit of a company and then trade out of it
he 's written this book the art of the deal
why does n't he just follow through on one of these things
mr. trump withdrew his bid before the amr board which is due to meet tomorrow ever formally considered it
amr had weighed a wide range of possible responses from flat rejection to recapitalizations and leveraged buy-outs that might have included either employees a friendlier buyer such as texas billionaire robert bass or both
amr had also sought to foil mr. trump in congress by lobbying for legislation that would have bolstered the authority of the transportation department to reject airline buy-outs
yesterday mr. trump tried to put the blame for the collapse of the ual deal on congress saying it was rushing through a bill to protect amr executives
i believe that the perception that legislation in this area may be hastily approved contributed to the collapse of the ual transaction and the resulting disruption in the financial markets experienced this past friday mr. trump wrote members of congress
amr declined to comment and mr. trump did n't respond to requests for interviews
mr. trump never said how much amr stock he had bought only that his holdings were substantial
however he only received federal clearance to buy more than $ 15 million of the stock on sept. 20 when the price rose $ 2 a share to $ 78.50
between then and his bid on oct. 5 the price fluctuated between $ 75.625 and $ 87.375
in an attempt to persuade investors that his bid was n't just a stock play mr. trump promised last week to notify the market before selling any shares
amr was trading at around $ 84 yesterday before his withdrawal announcement then immediately fell to about $ 76
assuming that he paid a rough average price of $ 80 a share and assuming he did n't sell before his announcement reached the market mr. trump could be sitting with a modest loss with the stock at $ 76.50
some analysts said amr chairman robert crandall might seize the opportunity presented by the stock price drop to protect the nation 's largest airline with a defensive transaction such as the sale of stock to a friendly holder or company employees
however other knowledgeable observers said they believed mr. crandall and the amr board might well decide to tough it out without taking any extra steps
some analysts said they believed mr. trump whose towering ego had been viewed by some as a reason to believe he would n't back out might come back with a lower bid
ray neidl of dillon read & co. said mr. trump is stepping back and waiting for the dust to settle
i 'm sure he still wants amr
but others remained skeptical
i was never sure donald trump really wanted to take amr said john mattis a bond analyst with shearson lehman hutton inc
what happened with united was a gracious way for him to bow out
mr. trump never obtained financing for his bid
that skepticism would leave him with an even greater credibility problem should he return that would handicap him in any effort to oust the board in a proxy fight
meanwhile citicorp and chase manhattan corp. the two lead lenders on the ual buy-out met with other banks yesterday to determine if they would be willing to finance the buy-out at a lower price
officials familiar with the talks said citicorp had discussed lowering the offer to $ 250 a share but said that price was a talking point and that no decision has been made
at $ 250 a share the group would have to borrow about $ 6.1 billion from banks
the first ual deal unraveled after citibank and chase could n't raise $ 7.2 billion
citibank and chase had agreed to commit $ 3 billion and said they were highly confident of raising another $ 4.2 billion
together citicorp and chase received $ 8 million in fees to raise the rest of the financing
but other banks balked at the low interest rate and banking fees the ual group was willing to pay them
officials familiar with the bank talks said the ual buy-out group ual pilots management and british airways plc is now willing to pay higher bank fees and interest but is n't likely to boost its $ 965 million equity contribution
nor is the group likely to come forward with a revised offer within the next 48 hours despite the hopes of many traders
the group 's advisers want to make certain they have firm bank commitments the second time around
even if the buy-out group is able to obtain financing the transaction still faces obstacles
ual 's board could reject the new price as too low especially since there are n't any competing bids
los angeles investor marvin davis whose $ 275-a-share offer was rejected by ual 's board has n't shown signs of pursuing a $ 300-a-share back-up bid he made last month
in addition the coalition of labor and management longtime enemies who joined forces only under the threat of mr. davis 's bid could break apart now
the group 's resilience gets its first test today when 30 top pilot union leaders convene outside chicago in a previously scheduled meeting
union chairman f.c. rick dubinsky faces the tough task of explaining why banks refused to finance a buy-out the members approved overwhelmingly last week
the pilot union is vowing to pursue an acquisition whatever the board decides
but if the board rejects a reduced bid and decides to explore other alternatives it could transform what has been a harmonious process into an adversarial one
the pilots could play hardball by noting they are crucial to any sale or restructuring because they can refuse to fly the airplanes
if they were to insist on a low bid of say $ 200 a share the board might n't be able to obtain a higher offer from other bidders because banks might hesitate to finance a transaction the pilots oppose
also because ual chairman stephen wolf and other ual executives have joined the pilots ' bid the board might be forced to exclude him from its deliberations in order to be fair to other bidders
that could cost him the chance to influence the outcome and perhaps join the winning bidder
influential members of the house ways and means committee introduced legislation that would restrict how the new savings-and-loan bailout agency can raise capital creating another potential obstacle to the government 's sale of sick thrifts
the bill whose backers include chairman dan rostenkowski d. ill. would prevent the resolution trust corp. from raising temporary working capital by having an rtc-owned bank or thrift issue debt that would n't be counted on the federal budget
the bill intends to restrict the rtc to treasury borrowings only unless the agency receives specific congressional authorization
such agency self-help borrowing is unauthorized and expensive far more expensive than direct treasury borrowing said rep. fortney stark d. calif. the bill 's chief sponsor
the complex financing plan in the s&l bailout law includes raising $ 30 billion from debt issued by the newly created rtc
this financing system was created in the new law in order to keep the bailout spending from swelling the budget deficit
another $ 20 billion would be raised through treasury bonds which pay lower interest rates
but the rtc also requires working capital to maintain the bad assets of thrifts that are sold until the assets can be sold separately
that debt would be paid off as the assets are sold leaving the total spending for the bailout at $ 50 billion or $ 166 billion including interest over 10 years
it 's a problem that clearly has to be resolved said david cooke executive director of the rtc
the agency has already spent roughly $ 19 billion selling 34 insolvent s&ls and it is likely to sell or merge 600 by the time the bailout concludes
absent other working capital he said the rtc would be forced to delay other thrift resolutions until cash could be raised by selling the bad assets
we would have to wait until we have collected on those assets before we can move forward he said
the complicated language in the huge new law has muddied the fight
the law does allow the rtc to borrow from the treasury up to $ 5 billion at any time
moreover it says the rtc 's total obligations may not exceed $ 50 billion but that figure is derived after including notes and other debt and subtracting from it the market value of the assets the rtc holds
but congress did n't anticipate or intend more public debt say opponents of the rtc 's working-capital plan and rep. charles schumer d. n.y. said the rtc oversight board has been remiss in not keeping congress informed
that secrecy leads to a proposal like the one from ways and means which seems to me sort of draconian he said
the rtc is going to have to pay a price of prior consultation on the hill if they want that kind of flexibility
the ways and means committee will hold a hearing on the bill next tuesday
we 're about to see if advertising works
hard on the heels of friday 's 190-point stock-market plunge and the uncertainty that 's followed a few big brokerage firms are rolling out new ads trumpeting a familiar message keep on investing the market 's just fine
their mission is to keep clients from fleeing the market as individual investors did in droves after the crash in october
just days after the 1987 crash major brokerage firms rushed out ads to calm investors
this time around they 're moving even faster
painewebber inc. filmed a new television commercial at 4 p.m. edt yesterday and had it on the air by last night
fidelity investments placed new ads in newspapers yesterday and wrote another new ad appearing today
shearson lehman hutton inc. by yesterday afternoon had already written new tv ads
it considered running them during tomorrow night 's world series broadcast but decided not to when the market recovered yesterday
other brokerage firms including merrill lynch & co. were plotting out potential new ad strategies
the brokerage firms learned a lesson the last time around when frightened investors flooded the phone lines and fled the market in a panic
this time the firms were ready
fidelity for example prepared ads several months ago in case of a market plunge
when the market went into its free fall friday afternoon the investment firm ordered full pages in the monday editions of half a dozen newspapers
the ads touted fidelity 's automated 800-number beneath the huge headline fidelity is ready for your call
a fidelity spokesman says the 800-line which already was operating but which many clients did n't know about received about double the usual volume of calls over the weekend
a lot of investor confidence comes from the fact that they can speak to us he says
to maintain that dialogue is absolutely crucial
it would have been too late to think about on friday
we had to think about it ahead of time
today 's fidelity ad goes a step further encouraging investors to stay in the market or even to plunge in with fidelity
underneath the headline diversification it counsels based on the events of the past week all investors need to know their portfolios are balanced to help protect them against the market 's volatility
it goes on to plug a few diversified fidelity funds by name
painewebber also was able to gear up quickly thanks to the 1987 crash
in the aftermath of the 1987 debacle the brokerage firm began taping commercials in-house ultimately getting its timing down fast enough to tape a commercial after the market closed and rush it on the air that night
it also negotiated an arrangement with cable news network under which cnn would agree to air its last-minute creations
the new painewebber commercial created with ad agency saatchi & saatchi co. features mary farrell one of the firm 's most visible investment strategists sounding particularly bullish
taped just as the market closed yesterday it offers ms. farrell advising we view the market here as going through a relatively normal cycle
we continue to feel that the stock market is still the place to be for long-term appreciation
the spot was scheduled to appear three times on cnn last night
painewebber considered an even harder sell recommending specific stocks
instead it settled on just urging the clients who are its lifeline to keep that money in the market
we 're saying the worst thing that anyone can do is to see the market go down and dump everything which just drives the prices down further says john lampe painewebber 's director of advertising
if you owned it and liked it friday the true value has n't changed
he adds this is n't 1987 revisited
with the market fluctuating and then closing up more than 88 points yesterday investment firms had to constantly revise their approach
at shearson lehman executives created potential new commercials friday night and throughout the weekend then had to regroup yesterday afternoon
the plan had been to make one of shearson 's easy-to-film black-and-white where we stand commercials which have been running occasionally in response to news events since 1985
the ad would have run during the world series tomorrow replacing the debut commercial of shearson 's new ad campaign leadership by example
but in a meeting after the market closed yesterday shearson executives decided not to go ahead with the stock-market ad
we do n't think at this point anything needs to be said
the market seems to be straightening out we 're taking a wait-and-see attitude says cathleen b. stewart executive vice president of marketing
in any case the brokerage firms are clearly moving faster to create new ads than they did in the fall of 1987
but it remains to be seen whether their ads will be any more effective
in 1987 despite a barrage of ads from most of the major investment firms individuals ran from the market en masse
now the firms must try their hardest to prove that advertising can work this time around

baseball that game of the long haul is the quintessential sport of the mean and the mean ol' law caught up with the san francisco giants in the world series last weekend
the team that dumped runs by the bushel on the chicago cubs in the national league playoffs was held to just one in two games by the home-team oakland a 's the gang that had been done unto similarly by the los angeles dodgers and orel hershiser in last year 's tournament
morever much of the damage was accomplished by a 's who had some catching up to do
in game two on a cool sunday evening in this land of perpetual autumn a lot of the catching up was done by the a 's catcher terry steinbach
he hit a 2-0 pitch from rick reuschel into the left-field stands in inning four to stretch his team 's lead from 2-1 to a decisive 5-1 where it stayed
so what if steinbach had struck just seven home runs in 130 regular-season games and batted in the seventh position of the a 's lineup
if you get your pitch and take a good swing anything can happen he later remarked
on saturday night quite a few of the boys in green and gold salted away successes to salve the pain of past and no doubt future droughts
mark mcgwire the big red-haired oakland first baseman had three hits in four at bats two more than he 'd had in the five-game dodger series in which he 'd gone 1-for-17
the a-men batting nos. 6 through 9 a.k.a. the bottom of the order got seven of their team 's 11 hits and scored four of its runs in a 5-0 decision
right-hander dave stewart held the giants to five hits to account for the zero on the other side of the saturday ledger
that he was the a 's winningest pitcher during its american league campaign with a 21-9 mark plus two wins over toronto in the playoffs indicates he may have some evening up coming but with the way his split-fingered fastball is behaving that might not be this week
the same goes for mike moore another veteran who overcame early struggles to permit the giants but a run and four hits in seven innings in sunday 's contest
every guy they put out there had a better split-finger than the guy before marveled giant manager roger craig
he 's an ex-hurler who 's one of the leading gurus of the fashionable delivery which looks like a fastball until it dives beneath the lunging bat
the upshot of the downshoot is that the a 's go into san francisco 's candlestick park tonight up two games to none in the best-of-seven fest
the stat to reckon with here says that about three of four clubs 29 of 39 that took 2-0 series leads went on to win it all
that 's not an average to soothe giant rooters
one might think that the home fans in this series of the subway called bart that 's a better name for a public conveyance than desire do n't you think would have been ecstatic over the proceedings but they observe them in relative calm
partisans of the two combatants sat side by side in the 49,000-plus seats of oakland coliseum and while they cheered their favorites and booed the opposition hostilities advanced no further at least as far as i could see
a few folks even showed up wearing caps bearing the colors and emblems of both teams
i 'm for the giants today but only because they lost yesterday
i love 'em both
the only thing i 'm rooting for is for the series to go seven games said david williams a sacramento septuagenarian at the coliseum before sunday 's go
the above represents a triumph of either apathy or civility
i choose to believe it 's the latter although it probably springs from the fact that just about everyone out here including the a 's and giants is originally from somewhere else
suffice it to say that if this were a new york yankees-mets series or one between the chicago cubs and white sox hey it 's possible you 'd need uniformed police in every other seat to separate opposing fans and only the suicidal would bifurcate their bonnets
anyway the a 's gave you a lot of heroes to root for
in the opening game besides steinbach and stewart there was walt weiss a twiggy-looking second-year shortstop who had lost a couple months of the season to knee surgery
he was flawless afield ditto in game two moved a runner along in the a 's three-run second inning and homered for his team 's final tally
such is his reputation among the east bay bashers that when he hit his first career home run last season the fan who caught it agreed to turn the ball over to him in return for an autograph
not his autograph power-hitter mcgwire 's
an a 's co-hero of the second game was rickey henderson who exemplifies the hot side of the hot-cold equation
he smoked toronto in the playoffs with six hits seven walks and eight stolen bases in 22 at bats and continued that by going 3-for-3 at the plate sunday along with walking stealing a base and scoring a run
when you 're in the groove you see every ball tremendously he lectured
the cold guys in the set were will clark kevin mitchell and matt williams the giants ' 3-4-5 hitters
they combined for 25 hits six home runs and 24 runs batted in in the five games against the cubs
they went a collective 5-for-24 here with zero homers and ribbies
it 's that last set of numbers as much as anything else that gives the giants hope in the series games to come
i believe in the law of averages declared san francisco batting coach dusty baker after game two
i 'd rather see a so-so hitter who 's hot come up for the other side than a good hitter who 's cold

ncr corp. reported a 10 % drop in third-quarter net income citing intense competition that caused its gross profit margins to dip
net income for the quarter fell to $ 93.1 million from $ 103.1 million roughly what analysts had expected
but per-share profit dropped only 2 % to $ 1.23 a share from $ 1.26 a share as the company continued its stock buy-back plan
average shares outstanding dropped to 75.8 million from 82.1 million
revenue fell 1 % to $ 1.39 billion from $ 1.41 billion
the computer maker which sells more than half its goods outside the u.s. also said the negative effect of a stronger u.s. dollar will adversely affect its fourth-quarter performance and make it difficult to better 1988 results
ncr said revenue declined both in the u.s. and overseas reflecting a world-wide softening of the computer markets
the company however said orders in the u.s. showed good gains during the latest quarter
analysts estimate those gains at 12 % to 13 % a good part of it coming from large orders placed by a few of ncr 's major customers
in addition to a general slowing of the computer industry ncr which sells automated teller machines and computerized cash registers is also affected by the retail and financial sectors areas of the economy that have generally not been robust notes sanjiv g. hingorani an analyst for salomon brothers inc
these factors combined with a strong dollar should negatively affect the current quarter 's results ncr said
in the year-earlier fourth quarter ncr had profit of $ 149.6 million or $ 1.85 a share on revenue of $ 1.8 billion
mr. hingorani said he lowered his full-year estimates for 1989 to $ 5.35 a share from $ 5.50 a share
revenue projections were slashed to $ 6.03 billion from $ 6.20 billion
last year ncr had net income of $ 439.3 million or $ 5.33 a share on $ 5.99 billion in revenue
for the nine months the company 's earnings fell 9 % to $ 264.6 million or $ 3.40 a share from $ 289.7 million or $ 3.49 a share
revenues declined 1 % to $ 4.17 billion from $ 4.19 billion
in new york stock exchange composite trading yesterday ncr shares fell 75 cents to close at $ 57
concerning your sept. 19 article wall street firms link analysts ' pay to performance i 'm delighted that wall street is finally tuning in to the hard cold facts of the real working world
if the firms are serious however why limit the practice to the poor maligned analysts whose ability to see into the future is fragile at best
why not extend the same harsh standards to the sales force and pay brokers a base salary with annual bonus based on how much money they made for their clients during the year
that should stop a lot of account-churning and produce a stock market driven only by professional concern careful thought and good sense
now would n't that be a novelty
phyllis kyle stephenson newport news va
steve clark a shearson lehman hutton inc. trader reported for work at 5 a.m. two and a half hours before the usual monday morning strategy meeting
at jefferies & co. j. francis palamara did n't reach the office until 5:30 a.m. but then he had been up most of the night at home
i had calls all night long from the states he said
i was woken up every hour 1:30 2:30 3:30 4:30
people are looking for possible opportunities to buy but nobody wants to stick their chin out
for many of london 's securities traders it was a day that started nervously in the small hours
by lunchtime the selling was at near-panic fever
but as the day ended in a frantic wall street-inspired rally the city breathed a sigh of relief
so it went yesterday in the trading rooms of london 's financial district
in the wake of wall street 's plunge last friday the london market was considered especially vulnerable
and before the opening of trading here yesterday all eyes were on early trading in tokyo for a clue as to how widespread the fallout might be
by the time trading officially got under way at 9 a.m. the news from asia was in
and it left mixed signals for london
tokyo stocks closed off a significant but less-than-alarming 1.8 % on thin volume hong kong stocks declined 6.5 % in orderly trading
at jefferies ' trading room on finsbury circus a stately circle at the edge of the financial district desktop computer screens displayed the london market 's major barometer the financial times-stock exchange 100 share index
red figures on the screens indicated falling stocks blue figures rising stocks
right away the reds outnumbered the blues 80 to 20 as the index opened at 2076.8 off 157.1 points or 7 %
i see concern but i do n't see any panic said mr. palamara a big good-humored new york native who runs the 15-trader office
the jefferies office a branch of the los angeles-based firm played it conservatively seeking to avoid risk
this is not the sort of market to have a big position in said david smith who heads trading in all non-u.s. stocks
we tend to run a very tight book
jefferies spent most of its energies in the morning trying to match buyers and sellers and there were n't many buyers
all the takeover stocks scottish & newcastle b.a.t drg are getting pretty well pasted this morning mr. smith said
seconds later a 7,500-share sell order for scottish & newcastle came in
for the third time in 15 minutes a trader next to mr. smith left the no-smoking area to have a cigarette
on the screens only two forlorn blue figures remained but the index had recovered a few points and was off about 140
because tokyo did n't collapse let 's pick up a little stock mr. smith said
he targeted 7,500 shares of reuters and punched a button to call up on his screen other dealers ' price quotes
the vivid yellow figures showed the best price at 845 pence $ 13.27 and mr. smith 's traders started putting out feelers
but the market sensed a serious buyer on a day dominated by selling and the quotes immediately jumped to 850 pence
when i want to buy they run from you they keep changing their prices mr. smith said
it 's very frustrating
he temporarily abandoned his search for the reuters shares
by this time it was 4:30 a.m. in new york and mr. smith fielded a call from a new york customer wanting an opinion on the british stock market which had been having troubles of its own even before friday 's new york market break
fundamentally dangerous mr. smith said almost in a whisper fundamentally weak fairly vulnerable still extremely dangerously poised
we 're in for a lot of turbulence
he was right
by midday the london market was in full retreat
it 's falling like a stone said danny linger a pit trader who was standing outside the london international financial futures exchange
only half the usual lunchtime crowd gathered at the tony corney & barrow wine bar on old broad street nearby
conversation was subdued as most patrons watched the latest market statistics on television
at 12:49 p.m. the index hit its low 2029.7 off 204.2 points
france opened the limit down off at least 10 % if you could calculate the index which you could n't mr. clark the shearson trader said early in the afternoon
spain is down 10 % and suspended sweden 's down 8 % norway 11 %
this market has been very badly damaged
as 2:30 p.m. wall street 's opening time neared shearson traders and salesmen traded bets on how low the new york market would open
in the center of the trading floor chief trader roger streeter and two colleagues scrambled for the telephones as soon as the new york market opened plummeting more than 60 points in the first few minutes
they saw an opportunity created by the sell-off
as wall street traders dumped american depositary receipts in jaguar plc mr. streeter and trader sam ruiz bought them to resell in the u.k
investors here still expect ford motor co. or general motors corp. to bid for jaguar
suddenly after about 45 minutes the u.s. markets rallied
the mmi has gone better shouted one trader at about 3:15 london time as the u.s. major markets index contract suddenly indicated a turnabout
as wall street strengthened the london trading room went wild
traders shouted as their screens posted an ever-narrowing loss on wall street
then nine minutes later wall street suddenly rebounded to a gain on the day
rally rally rally shouted shearson trader andy rosen selling more jaguar shares
this is panic buying
as the london market rallied some wondered whether the weekend of worrying and jitters had been worth it
the london index closed at 2163.4 its high for the day off 70.5 or about 3.3 %
ambassador paul nitze 's statement notable & quotable sept. 20 if you have a million people working for you every bad thing that has one chance in a million of going wrong will go wrong at least once a year is a pretty negative way of looking at things
is n't it just as fair to say that if you have a million people working for you every good thing that has one chance in a million of going right will go right at least once a year
do n't be such a pessimist mr. ambassador

the house aviation subcommittee approved a bill that would give the transportation secretary authority to review and approve leveraged buy-outs of major u.s. airlines
the collapsed plan to acquire ual corp. parent of united airlines spurred quick action on the legislation introduced wednesday and approved by the subcommittee on a voice vote yesterday
the bill is expected to be taken up by the public works and transportation committee tomorrow and a floor vote by next week will be urged
the measure drew criticism from the bush administration and a parting shot from financier donald trump who yesterday withdrew his takeover bid for amr corp. the parent of american airlines
in a letter to subcommittee chairman james oberstar d. minn. mr. trump criticized the bill as an explicit effort to thwart his bid for amr and said it contributed to the collapse of the deal
elaine chao deputy transportation secretary also sent a letter to express the administration 's opposition to the bill in its present form
rep. oberstar brushed off mr. trump 's allegations as an excuse for his own deal failing
he also said the fact that the other letter had n't come from transportation secretary samuel skinner indicated there is wiggle room in the administration 's position
mr. oberstar and other committee members repeatedly stressed that the legislation was n't a response to any particular market situation
but they cited the ual and amr examples as reasons to move quickly to enact this legislation
aides both in the house and senate said the withdrawal of the trump bid for amr is n't likely to deflate efforts to push the legislation
it 's still on the fast track and we still want to do it said one senate aide
the bill is aimed at addressing the concern that an airline might sacrifice costly safety measures to pay off the debt incurred in a leveraged buy-out
currently the transportation secretary does n't have clearly established authority to block mergers but can take the drastic step of revoking the operating certificate of any carrier the official considers unfit
supporters of the legislation view the bill as an effort to add stability and certainty to the airline-acquisition process and to preserve the safety and fitness of the industry
in general the bill would give the transportation department a 30-day review period before 15 % or more of the voting stock of a major u.s. air carrier could be acquired
it also would require the acquiring party to notify the transportation secretary and to provide all information relevant to determining the intent of the acquisition
the bill would allow the secretary to reject a buy-out if sufficient information has n't been provided or if the buy-out is likely to weaken the carrier financially result in a substantial reduction in size of the airline through disposal of assets or give control to a foreign interest
if more information is needed the secretary would have authority to extend the review period 20 days
all the witnesses both congressmen and industry experts expressed support for the bill in order to prevent profiteers from cashing in on airline profits at the expense of safe cost-effective service
but several committee members disapproved some backing mr. trump 's claim that the threat of regulation caused the failure of the ual deal and the stock-market plunge
one of the major concerns expressed by the dissenters was that large airlines would be prohibited from divesting themselves of smaller entities and producing independent spin-off companies
in a possible prelude to the resumption of talks between boeing co. and striking machinists union members a federal mediator said representatives of the two sides will meet with him tomorrow
it could be a long meeting or it could be a short one said doug hammond the mediator who called the agreement to meet a first step toward a resumption of negotiations
we 're encouraged that talks are scheduled again but beyond that we have made no expression of expectations a boeing spokesman said
the machinists union has rejected a three-year contract offer that would have provided a 10 % wage increase over the life of the pact plus some bonuses
currently average pay for machinists is $ 13.39 an hour boeing said
now in its 13th day the strike has idled about 55,000 machinists and has started to delay delivery of some jetliners
with a strike fund of about $ 100 million the union had said it was prepared for a long strike
after the third week on strike union members will begin receiving $ 100 a week from the fund
work at boeing continues with supervisors and other non-striking personnel manning the lines
and at the company 's wichita kan. plant about 2,400 of the 11,700 machinists still are working boeing said
under kansas right-to-work laws contracts can not require workers to be union members
boeing has declined to say how many employees are working at its giant renton wash. plant
union officials could n't be reached for comment
dpc acquisition partners a hostile suitor for dataproducts corp. said it intends to launch a tender offer for the computer printer maker 's common stock
dpc a group led by the new york investment firm crescott inc. also said it plans to file preliminary materials with the securities and exchange commission regarding a shareholder solicitation to oust dataproducts ' board
dpc holds a 7.8 % stake in dataproducts and made a $ 15-a-share bid for the company in may but dataproducts management considered the $ 283.7 million proposal unacceptable
a dpc spokesman declined to elaborate on the group 's new plan
in american stock exchange composite trading yesterday dataproducts shares jumped 62.5 cents to close at $ 9.375
dataproducts which had been seeking a buyer for several months announced a restructuring plan in september and took itself off the auction block
the company 's restructuring includes plans to split into three sectors to phase out domestic printer manufacturing operations and to sell its new england subsidiary
as part of the plan dataproducts announced a pact to sell $ 63 million of its real estate holdings to trizec properties inc. a unit of canada 's trizec corp
jack davis dataproducts ' president chairman and chief executive officer said the company is at a loss to understand dpc 's intentions
he called today 's announcement opportunistic and disruptive and said the company intends to proceed with its restructuring
share prices plummeted across europe yesterday in response to friday 's new york sell-off but some issues staged a late comeback after wall street opened without another rout
european investors have further reason for optimism today after the u.s. rebound
the frankfurt stock exchange which closed before the new york exchanges opened was the hardest hit of the major european markets with the dax index dropping 12.8 %
in london prices plummeted in early trading and were off as much as 9 % before coming back strong after the new york opening to close down only 3.2 %
west german economics minister helmut haussmann said in my view the stock market will stabilize relatively quickly
there may be one or other psychological or technical reactions but they are n't based on fundamentals
the economy of west germany and the ec european community is highly stable
paris which has been the center of speculation fever in recent weeks also was hard hit
share prices fell in milan amsterdam zurich madrid and stockholm
prices in brussels where a computer breakdown disrupted trading also tumbled
following is a breakdown of major market activity
frankfurt
one of the sharpest declines came in the financial center of europe 's strongest economy
the dax index of 30 west german blue chips plunged 12.8 % a one-day record wiping out the summer 's gains
the index closed at 1385.72 down 203.56 points
by comparison two years ago on black monday the new index would have dropped 9.4 % according to a projection by the exchange
investors may have reacted so strongly to friday 's u.s. stock market loss because they had vivid memories of the frankfurt exchange 's losing 35 % of its value in the 1987 crash and its wake
this time however many small investors may have been hurt by acting so swiftly
they all went in the wrong direction said andreas insam an investment adviser for the bank in liechtenstein 's frankfurt branch
he said he told clients to buy selected west german blue chips after they fell by about 10 %
after the opening was delayed 30 minutes because of the crush of sell orders frankfurt 's normal two-hour trading session was extended 75 minutes to handle the heavy volume
the beginning was chaotic said nigel longley a broker for commerzbank ag
it took three-quarters of an hour before enough prices could be worked out to get a reading on the market
institutional investors and bankers many of whom spent the night before in their offices watching far eastern markets were cautiously optimistic after the mild 1.8 % decline in tokyo stock prices
everybody was still confident including most institutional investors
that is why everybody was a little surprised by the storm of sell orders from small private investors said norbert braeuer a senior trader for hessische landesbank
some big institutions including banks began picking up lower-priced shares late yesterday but most investors wanted to see what would happen in new york before acting
but even if wall street continues to stabilize analysts here say the latest blow to investor confidence could inhibit a swift recovery for the frankfurt exchange which already was showing signs of weakness after the dax had slipped from a 1989 high of 1657.61 on sept. 8
some of west germany 's bluest chips took some of the biggest hits
a 16.3 % drop for mannesmann ag and dresdner bank ag 's 9.6 % decline were especially problematic for their respective boards whose plans for major rights issues in november could now be in jeopardy
dresdner bank last month said it hoped to raise 1.2 billion marks $ 642.2 million by issuing four million shares at 300 marks each
yet yesterday 's market cropped dresdner 's share price by 33 marks to 309 marks a share leaving little incentive for investors to subscribe to the standing price unless the market recovers quickly
london
headed toward a record drop at midday the london stock market recouped two-thirds of its losses in the wake of new york 's early rally
the financial times-stock exchange 100 share index closed off 70.5 points at 2163.4 its high for the day after having plunged 204.2 points at 12:49 p.m
it was big institutions such as norwich union insurance group scottish amicable investment managers and standard life assurance co. that spearheaded the rally
attracted by low prices and encouraged by new york 's performance they scooped up equities across the board
volume was 959.3 million shares more than triple recent levels
paris
late buying gave the paris bourse a parachute after its free fall early in the day
the cac general index ended down 5.4 % at 523.6 a drop of 29.6 points from friday
there was a volatility in the market that i have never seen before said michel vigier a partner in brokerage firm cholet dupont
when wall street turned around shortly after the opening there was panic buying in paris
brokers said that as the news spread that wall street was moving up traders who had called to place sell orders changed their line in mid-conversation ordering buys instead
trading was driven primarily by small investors and speculators with large institutions waiting on the sidelines until late in the day
when wall street turned however the big boys entered the market looking for bargains
j.p. morgan & co. swung to a loss in the third quarter while ncnb corp. reported net income more than doubled and security pacific corp. net rose 10 %
j.p. morgan & co
j.p. morgan as expected posted a $ 1.82 billion net loss for the quarter reflecting the new york bank 's decision last month to add $ 2 billion to reserves for losses on loans to less-developed countries
the reserve addition placed the parent of morgan guaranty trust co. among a few major u.s. banks that have covered nearly all their medium and long-term portfolios to less-developed countries with reserves
the latest quarter 's loss equals $ 9.92 a share
in the year-earlier quarter morgan earned $ 233.6 million or $ 1.25 a share
george m. salem analyst at prudential-bache securities inc. called the results mildly disappointing
excluding the $ 2 billion provision and allowing for the taxes morgan paid earnings were about 65 cents a share mr. salem said
in new york stock exchange composite trading yesterday morgan climbed $ 1.50 a share to $ 44.125
net interest income sank 27 % in the quarter to $ 254 million from $ 347 million
the interest rate on short-term funds which banks borrow to finance longer-term loans to customers was sharply higher morgan said
morgan received $ 2 million of interest payments on its medium and long-term brazilian loans had they been accruing interest net interest income would have been $ 35 million higher in the quarter morgan said
such loans to argentina also remain classified as non-accruing costing the bank $ 10 million of interest income in the third period
income from sources other than interest climbed 12 % to $ 414 million reflecting higher corporate-finance and other fees and gains on sales of investment securities
these increases were partly offset by lower trading-related income the bank said
non-interest expenses grew 16 % to $ 496 million
ncnb corp
ncnb corp. 's net income more than doubled in the period largely because of continued strong performance by the bank 's texas operations
the charlotte n.c. company said earnings rose to $ 143.6 million or $ 1.45 a share from $ 58.9 million or 69 cents a share a year earlier
the latest quarter included a gain of $ 56.1 million or 59 cents a share related to the purchase of the remaining 51 % of ncnb texas national bank from the federal deposit insurance corp
the strong performance however contrasted with an unexpectedly large increase in the size of ncnb 's problem loans particularly in the southeast
in the third quarter nonperforming assets jumped to $ 474.1 million or 1.43 % of net loans and leases from $ 232.8 million or 1.13 % in the second quarter
nonperformers totaled $ 230.8 million or 1.27 % in the year-ago third quarter
included in the increase in the most recent quarter is a $ 33 million loan which ncnb said it expects to be fully repaid with no loss early in the fourth quarter
the deterioration in credit quality offset strong loan growth of 17 % in ncnb 's southeast operations as well as a 28 % growth in deposits resulting from an aggressive marketing campaign
the higher rates paid on deposits also helped squeeze ncnb 's net interest margin in the southeast to 3.38 % from 3.80 % a year earlier
in big board composite trading yesterday ncnb jumped $ 3.50 a share to $ 51
results were released after the market closed
ncnb texas national formed from the remnants of of the failed first republicbank corp. of dallas contributed $ 76.9 million to ncnb 's bottom line in the third quarter
ncnb said its third-quarter results reflect 100 % of earnings of the texas operation since aug. 1
ncnb raised some $ 1.9 billion in new capital during the quarter to complete the ncnb texas purchase and to acquire several small failed thrifts to fill out its regional franchise
last week the banking company said it purchased both freedom savings & loan association tampa fla. and university federal savings association of san antonio texas for $ 169.4 million
in the first nine months ncnb 's net income climbed 65 % to $ 310.9 million or $ 3.30 a share from $ 188.2 million or $ 2.22 a share a year earlier
security pacific corp
security pacific 's earnings growth slowed in the third quarter but the los angeles bank holding company was still able to post a 10 % increase in net income because of robust growth in residential real-estate and consumer loans
net rose to $ 185.1 million or $ 1.55 a share from $ 167.9 million or $ 1.47 a share a year earlier
the company said the gain resulted mainly from a $ 54 million increase in net interest income reflecting a 33 % increase in real estate loans mainly residential and a 19 % rise in consumer loans
these high-yielding loans in effect replaced some low-yielding assets such as inter-bank loans which were allowed to decrease
as a result security pacific 's net interest margin fell only 13 basis points a more mild decrease than some major banks outside california which have been reporting more sluggish earnings
security pacific shares closed at $ 44.625 down 37.5 cents in big board composite trading
the earnings represent a 0.89 % return on assets for security pacific and an 18.9 % return on equity
the loan growth offset continuing real-estate loan losses in the depressed arizona market
security pacific reported a 33 % increase in net credit losses for the quarter to $ 109 million from $ 81.9 million in the year-ago period
nonperforming loans grew slightly to $ 1.75 billion at sept. 30 from $ 1.7 billion a year ago
security pacific 's loan-loss provision was down 22 % or $ 30.4 million because it added to its foreign-debt reserve the year before
non-interest income fell 6 % in the quarter mainly because of an unusual gain a year earlier from the sale of hong kong banking operations
non-interest expense grew only 4 % in the period
for the nine months net rose 17 % to $ 548.9 million or $ 4.67 a share from $ 469.4 million or $ 4.13 a share a year earlier
lin broadcasting corp. said it wo n't take a position on a revised tender offer by mccaw cellular communications inc. to buy lin and has asked for clarification of the offer
the new offer which seeks 50.3 % of the cellular and broadcasting concern is for $ 125 a share for 22 million lin shares
mccaw 's revised tender offer would require mccaw to begin an auction process in july 1994 that would buy out remaining holders at a per-share price roughly equivalent to what a third party might then have to pay for all of lin
lin is asking mccaw to clarify its tender offer which challenges an agreement between bellsouth corp. and lin to merge their cellular-telephone businesses
bellsouth has notified lin that it would shortly respond to the mccaw proposal in as full and effective a manner as is warranted
the lin board said holders may be misled by the provision in the mccaw proposal that guarantees private market value after five years for the remaining shares
mccaw has no obligation to purchase and the definition of private market value is uncertain the lin board said
the board added that mccaw would be able to control lin 's operations and could therefore operate lin in a manner which could diminish its private market value and attractiveness to a third-party purchaser in five years
in national over-the-counter trading lin closed at $ 104.75 down $ 2.75
a group of institutional investors in telerate inc. said that dow jones & co. 's $ 18-a-share offer for the electronic financial information services company is grossly inadequate
in a letter filed with the securities and exchange commission the group which holds about 4.5 million telerate shares or about 4.7 % of the shares outstanding said at present none of us believes an offer for less than $ 25 per share would be fair and some believe that $ 25 is too low
the letter was dated oct. 6
in composite trading on the new york stock exchange telerate shares closed yesterday at $ 18.875 down 75 cents a share
dow jones publisher of the wall street journal has launched an $ 18-a-share or $ 576 million tender offer to acquire the remaining telerate shares outstanding dow jones owns 67 % of telerate
telerate has rejected the offer which expires nov. 3
the group includes putnam cos. and various affiliates based in boston wells fargo bank san francisco the california public employees retirement system sacramento calif. and t. rowe price associates inc. baltimore
among other issues the group 's letter said it has concerns as to whether dow jones 's offer meets the applicable requirements of procedural fairness
a spokesman for dow jones said he had n't seen the group 's filing but added obviously dow jones disagrees with their conclusions
our offer is to buy any and all shares tendered at $ 18 a share
u.s. trade representative carla hills said the first dispute-settlement panel set up under the u.s.-canadian free trade agreement has ruled that canada 's restrictions on exports of pacific salmon and herring violate the accord
mrs. hills said the u.s. and canada have until nov. 13 to resolve the dispute
if a solution is n't reached by then she said the u.s. would have the right to suspend some trade concessions to canada equivalent in value to the losses suffered by u.s. fish-processing companies in alaska and the pacific northwest
however in ottawa canadian trade minister john crosbie said the dispute-settlement panel accepted the legitimacy of canada 's position on the use of these landing requirements to conserve and manage these important fisheries
questioned about the seeming contradiction in the u.s. and canadian government views of the panel 's report an aide for mrs. hills said the panel had clearly ruled that the canadian trade restrictions are illegal
the u.s. trade representative declined to put a dollar estimate on the losses resulting from the canadian export restrictions
canada initially had an export prohibition that was replaced by regulations requiring that such fish had to be brought ashore in british columbia by commercial fishermen prior to export
this action was defended by the canadian government on conservation grounds
mrs. hills said yesterday that the dispute-settlement panel rejected this canadian government argument
we fully expect that canada will comply with the panel 's ruling that the landing requirement also must be ended she said
earlier an international panel set up under the rules of the general agreement on tariffs and trade in geneva determined that the original canadian fish-export restrictions violated gatt rules
mrs. hills said the u.s. wo n't accept any delays after nov. 13 because u.s. fish-processing firms enter into contracts in the fall to purchase the next season 's catch
she said the canadian restrictions must be removed before such contracts are concluded

bancoklahoma corp. said it completed a restructuring agreement previously agreed to by the federal deposit insurance corp. creditor banks and subordinated debenture holders
the plan would permit the bank holding company to retire its bank and debenture obligations through exchanges of cash and equity
the fdic which in 1986 provided $ 130 million in open-bank assistance to bancoklahoma 's bank of oklahoma tulsa unit will continue to maintain $ 90 million in preferred stock in the tulsa bank unit
in exchange for the other $ 40 million the fdic will receive additional warrants entitling it to buy 60 % of bancoklahoma 's common stock outstanding up from the 55 % option the fdic received under terms of the 1986 capital infusion
in exchange for the $ 76 million they are owed creditor banks will receive 3.9 million shares of bancoklahoma common stock and the proceeds from the future sales of four subsidiary banks to private buyers the bank holding company said
also under the agreement debenture holders will get one million shares of common stock in exchange for $ 7.7 million in debentures and holders of bancoklahoma 's series a preferred stock will receive 1.25 shares of common stock for every share of preferred they own the company said

bsn corp. said it will begin an offer tomorrow to exchange up to one million of its common shares and all of its $ 16.6 million in 7 3/4 % convertible debentures due 2001 for a package of new debt and common stock warrants
under terms of the offer the sporting goods maker will swap $ 9 face amount of 9 1/4 % subordinated notes due 1996 and one warrant for each common share

bsn said it is making the offer to shrink its capital and increase shareholder value
if all the bondholders and holders of one million common shares accept the offer bsn will increase its debt by $ 9 million but it also will recognize a $ 2 million gain from retiring the old debt said michael j. blumenfeld president
we have sufficient cash flow to handle that he said

the market upheaval apparently has n't triggered any cash crunch yet
individual investors investment firms and arbitragers who speculate in the stocks of takeover candidates can suffer liquidity and payment problems when stocks dive those investors often borrow heavily to buy their holdings and use the stocks as collateral for loans

we 're seeing nothing out of the ordinary said one official at a top 10 bank

now as for tomorrow hell who knows
what happened friday shows that financial markets are not yet sufficiently coordinated to handle another meltdown in prices
no fiddling with systems and procedures will ever prevent markets from suffering a panic wave of selling
but markets can operate with greater or lesser efficiency
after the 1987 plunge markets agreed that it would be wise to halt trading whenever panic conditions arose
the new york stock exchange adopted two specific circuit breakers if the dow jones index falls 250 points in a day the exchange will halt trading for one hour if the decline hits 400 points the exchange will close for an additional two hours
the rationale is that an interruption of trading will allow investors to reconsider their strategies calm sellers and lead buyers to enter the market at indicated new price levels
it is impossible to know whether that theory is realistic
a temporary cessation of trading may indeed discourage a selling panic from feeding on itself
but there is also the possibility that shutting down markets will intensify fears and cause an even more abrupt slide in prices
what happened friday was the worst of all worlds
the futures exchanges followed their own pre-set circuit breakers and shut down at about 3 p.m. for 30 minutes after the standard & poor 's 500 stock index had fallen 12 points or about 100 points on the dow jones index
options markets stopped trading in many securities
the new york stock exchange under its own rules remained open
with nowhere else to go sellers and particularly program traders focused all their selling on the new york stock exchange
as liquidity on that market weakened prices fell sharply
had the futures and options markets been open additional liquidity would have been provided and the decline most probably would have been less intense
at 3:30 after intense telephone negotiations between the trading markets and washington the futures exchanges reopened
futures trading however was halted altogether at 3:45 after the futures markets had dropped an additional 30 points which is the daily limit for price declines
at this point the options markets also shut down and once more left all sales to be handled by the new york stock exchange
it is time to recognize that the new york stock exchange the futures markets and the options markets though physically separate have actually become so closely intertwined as to constitute one market effectively
traders can vary their strategies and execute their orders in any one of them
it therefore makes no sense for each market to adopt different circuit breakers
to achieve maximum liquidity and minimize price volatility either all markets should be open to trading or none
synchronized circuit breakers would not have halted the slide in prices on friday but they probably would have made for smoother less volatile executions
it 's time for the exchanges and the securities and exchange commission to agree on joint conditions for halting trading or staying open
let 's not have one market shut down for 30 minutes when the dow declines 100 points and another shut down for an hour after a 250-point decline
the need for hurried last-minute telephone negotiations among market officials will disappear once rules are in place that synchronize circuit breakers in all markets
the new circuit breakers if they are to be applied at all will require that futures and options trading continue as long as the new york stock exchange remains open
the rules should be established by agreement of the officials of all affected exchanges acting under the oversight and with the approval of the government regulatory agencies
should the sec and the commodities futures trading commission which with the sec regulates the chicago stock-index markets be unable to agree the issue may have to be resolved by decision of the treasury secretary
in many ways our financial markets are better prepared today to handle a decline than they were two years ago
the new york stock exchange now has the capacity to handle a volume of nearly a billion shares a day
telephone service has been improved for customers trying to reach their brokers and specialists who i believe should stay despite the urgings of some post-crash critics have larger capital positions
of course specialists ' actions alone can never prevent a major crack in stock prices
witness the fact that trading in some stocks closed early friday and opened late monday because of an excess of sell orders

clubbing a fan was n't the baltimore orioles ' fault
so said a federal judge in a case involving two players for the minor league bluefield va. orioles a baltimore farm team
the players were heckled by a patron during a july 4 1988 game with the martinsville phillies
like its parent that year bluefield was not having a good year the judge said
after the game bluefield lost 9-8 stranding three runners in the ninth he noted trouble began

yesterday was in the words of new york stock exchange chairman john j. phelan jr. just your reasonably normal 400 million-share up 88-points day
when it was all over and stocks had staged a huge recovery big board officials were self-congratulatory about how well the day had gone
they said the exchange 's trading procedures personnel equipment and links with other exchanges could n't have performed better
we had no operating problems at all mr. phelan said after the market closed
all the things that we set up to slow down the process to let people know that the market was in an extreme position worked extremely well
prices for the 416.3 million shares that changed hands during the session were carried on the exchange 's trading tape with barely a delay officials said
while reaching blockbuster proportions yesterday the volume was still well within the 600 million-share capacity that the exchange has said it can handle daily since beefing up its computers after the october 1987 crash
the so-called circuit breakers devised by the big board and the chicago mercantile exchange to quell free falls in stock and futures prices were n't triggered yesterday because the markets were higher for most of the day
despite traders ' complaints mr. phelan said the links with the chicago futures market worked as planned in friday 's rout to provide a cooling-off period
of greater help the big board chairman said was the natural circuit breaker of the weekend that provided a breathing period that brought rationality back to the market
chicken chains ruffled by loss of customers
fast-food chicken chains faced with a worsening business slump are struggling to hatch some new marketing strategies
the crest report which tracks consumer purchases says customer traffic at chicken restaurants fell 10 % in the second quarter while the overall fast-food customer count was down 2 %
chicken business is off largely because of more competition from grocery-store convenience food home-delivered pizza and other takeout fare says a spokesman for the report a publication of npd group a market research firm in port washington n.y
the loss of more customers is the latest in a string of problems

and the chain is testing products that are n't fried such as char-grilled chicken to try to win health-conscious consumers
kentucky fried chicken also is testing home-delivery of chicken which could be a hit with stay-at-home diners
but some fast-food industry analysts say problems with keeping chicken warm and fresh must be solved first
a kentucky fried chicken spokesman however disputed the notion that the delivery service experienced problems in some markets where testing has been discontinued

retailer sees pitfalls in environmental push
here 's a retailer that 's getting tough in the push for environmentally safe packaging and products
big bear supermarkets inc. a grocery chain based in san diego plans to display shelf cards and distribute pamphlets recommending products deemed safe for the environment
the choices will be based on research by the san diego environmental health coalition and will include products like murphy 's oil soap and other noncorrosive cleaners
but the chain is quickly realizing the pitfalls of such endorsements
for example it recommends nonchlorinated dishwasher detergent and puts sunlight on its environmentally safe list
that does n't thrill procter & gamble co. maker of cascade dishwasher detergent
a company spokesman questioned the validity of the list noting that chlorine is present in all major dishwasher detergents
in fact lever bros. confirms that its sunlight brand does contain chlorine bleach even though it is n't listed on the label for the powder version
thomas g. dahlen big bear 's executive vice president said the chain is still reviewing its product list to avoid such problems
our intent is to promote the best alternative he says
and it 's important that we be accurate
but in the end customers ' wishes are what will prevail

the continuing series of hud scandals is a sadly predictable result of pork-barrel politics
nevertheless lobbies such as the national association of home builders nahb continue to pressure capitol hill for more special-interest spending
kent colton nahb executive vice president argues that the u.s. faces a multifaceted housing crisis reduced affordability of homes for first-time buyers increased homelessness and lower apartment construction rates that will be very difficult to solve without expanded federal resources
there 's nothing unusual about business groups pushing for more government spending
but the nahb was created in 1943 out of an organization that made its name fighting a roosevelt administration proposal to take over all defense housing production
through the years the association has been an active member of the taxpayer 's coalition pushing for such initiatives as the balanced-budget amendment
yet on matters close to er home
the hud budget has dropped by more than 70 % since 1980 argues mr. colton
we 've taken more than our fair share
i would n't have a problem if other programs had taken a similar hit
but nahb support for subsidies is not related to the current housing crunch over the years the nahb has backed a host of public programs
it once pushed for a national housing production goal set by the federal government and has regularly advanced anti-recession housing measures
moreover explains one hud official the nahb remains susceptible to internal pressure from members that specialize in subsidized production
the association is pushing an extensive and expensive wish-list which would substantially boost spending above the current level of more than $ 15 billion annually
direct federal subsidies for housing construction have proved intolerably expensive in the past and inevitably are twisted to the benefit of well-connected developers and lobbyists as demonstrated by the ongoing hud scandal or congressmen
indirect subsidies through the fha for instance are little better
though mr. colton says expanding fha lending would result in no cost to the government the mere diversion of funds from other parts of the economy and from other forms of housing such as low-income to the single-family home market would result in a major expense
more important housing programs run by hud the va and fmha are awash in red ink
the fha alone lost $ 4.2 billion in fiscal 1988 the government 's equity in the agency essentially its reserve fund fell to minus $ 2.9 billion
the federal government has had to pump in $ 2.28 billion into the va housing program since 1984 to keep the fund afloat and the va requested an additional $ 120 million for the fiscal year just ended
all told the federal government already guarantees more than $ 900 billion of mortgages
in its nicely produced publication where will our children live the nahb does acknowledge that of course the full measure of housing affordability can not be provided by the federal government
it points to the pernicious impact of local government regulation particularly zoning and building fees which pushes the price of housing out of the reach of low- and middle-income people
but while the nahb has suggested actions that states and localities should take to reduce regulatory barriers the association has proposed no activist legislative program comparable to say its detailed request for more federal subsidies to eliminate counterproductive controls
the association a majority of whose 156,000 members build fewer than 25 units a year is like many other business lobbies
explains sheila macdonald of the national taxpayers union it treads in two worlds
the builders like the subsidies but at the same time they tend to be fiscal conservatives in terms of major issues such as the balanced-budget amendment
unfortunately the organization 's desire for pork tends to override its commitment to overall fiscal responsibility
two years ago when the nahb lobbied for the $ 19 billion omnibus housing bill the organization basically dropped out of the taxpayers ' coalition says ms. macdonald
as mr. colton of the nahb acknowledges government is not going to solve the problem
the real key is to have the economy working and interest rates down
more money for hud will increase the deficit and destabilize the economy more money to municipalities that are wrecking their local housing markets will further insulate them from the destructive effects of their policies
is this what the home builders want

in an attempt to give new momentum to european community plans for a single currency ec government leaders are likely to agree to set a date for starting formal talks on amending the ec 's founding treaty of rome
according to diplomatic sources in brussels most ec leaders agree that talks should begin in the second half of 1990 and will make a declaration on that during a summit meeting in strasbourg france on dec. 8 and 9
the only strong opposition to changing the ec treaty comes from british prime minister margaret thatcher who is opposed to creating a single ec currency
but the process of convening the intergovernmental conference does n't require unanimity
setting a date to start treaty negotiations has no legal significance in itself but could be viewed as an important psychological push
french president francois mitterrand fought to set a date for the conference during the ec summit in madrid last june but the move was scuttled because of opposition by mrs. thatcher and west german chancellor helmut kohl
diplomatic sources said mr. kohl may now agree to set a date for the conference to make it clear that west germany is still committed to ec unity
the latest crewcut in the equities markets reminds me of the joke t. boone pickens tells about the guy who was run over by the parade
when asked what went wrong the unfortunate victim replied it was a combination of things
and so it was on gray friday
the grand marshal of this parade would appear to have been excess leverage
even if that is so however it 's probably the case that no barriers should have been erected to stop the procession before the end of the rout e
the ceremonies began friday afternoon when word spread that the ual buy-out was collapsing
although the union-bidder expects to patch together a substitute offer consisting of less cash the failure to get cash from japanese and american banks confirmed a growing fear among arbitragers that the pageant of high-leverage takeover deals is ending
lots of other entries made up the parade of course notably a surprisingly large increase in producer prices signalling federal reserve tightness and the bush administration 's temporary defeat in trying to lower the capital-gains tax
as usual few favorable reviews were heard for that ever-present marching band of program traders although most serious studies suggest they only play the music that others write
what really spooked the crowds along wall street however was the sudden concern that whatever the reason the pool of debt capital is drying up
gray friday reflects a panic mainly by the takeover arbitragers rather than the small investor as their highly margined investments in the deal stocks are jeopardized by the unexpected drying up of the lubricant for deal financing
deal stocks led the market down as they absorbed the heaviest losses
ual which triggered the slide opened monday at $ 224 down about 20 % from thursday 's close
amr opened monday at $ 80 down nearly 20 % from thursday 's close
both took further hits yesterday
hilton lost 20 % on friday paramount lost almost 11 %
a careful look reveals that where deal financing has been secured the target 's stock price was not affected on friday
the multibillion-dollar prospects where the bidder must line up a consortium of banks and/or issue billions in high-yield debt were where the damage was concentrated
the market for so-called junk bonds has been setting the stage for friday 's dramatic march for several weeks
the growing financial difficulties of recent high-leverage restructurings or takeovers such as resorts international integrated resources and campeau 's retailing empire have cast a pall over the entire market for high-yield securities
investors have reacted by ignoring recent efforts to float junk bonds by ohio mattress and by forcing ramada to postpone indefinitely its planned junk-bond sale and restructuring
as a result high-yield mutual funds have declined across the board and the many firms planning to sell $ 11 billion in junk bonds before year-end are experiencing anxious times
these are all market excesses putting aside the artificial boosts that the tax code gives to debt over equity and what we 've seen is the market reining them in
of course washington had n't been silent in the days leading up to the debacle and its tendency to meddle in the leverage equation remains a troublesome prospect but those preliminary steps should n't distract us from the basic market fundamentalism that was at work on friday
if it is correct to find that concerns over corporate debt and lbos caused gray friday what are the implications for policy makers
after all the stock market 's response to the collapse of the ual deal might be taken to confirm the anti-debt direction of regulators
is this a case where private markets are approving of washington 's bashing of wall street
absolutely not
to the extent that friday 's sell-off reflected a sudden reappraisal of the excesses of leverage the message is that wall street and the private markets are fully capable of imposing the appropriate incentives and sanctions on corporate behavior
the national economic interests are much better served allowing the private interests of bankers and investors be the ultimate judges of the investment quality of various lbo deals and leveraged restructurings
the recent difficulties in the junk-bond markets and the scarcity of bank capital for recent deals underscores the wisdom of letting the free markets operate
if takeover premiums become excessive if lbo dealmakers become too aggressive then the private market will recognize these problems more quickly and accurately than will policy makers and the markets will move with lightning speed to impose appropriate sanctions
yes the broader exchanges got caught up in the spiral but they rode the tiger up all year
not surprisingly he sometimes bites
the arbitragers and takeover initiatiors got killed on gray friday while the besieged managers of prospective targets cheered lustily
if you identify with the besieged managers you must concede that speedy and effective relief from the excesses of the takeover market is more likely to come from the marketplace than from washington
if you side with the arbitragers and raiders you clearly have more to fear from private investors than from regulators although the delaware courts should never be underestimated
the truth is washington understands politics better than economics
although the average citizen is probably not harmed too much from washington 's rhetorical war against wall street regarding excessive financial leveraging actual legislation would probably impose considerable harm
any such attempt to distinguish good debt from bad debt or to draw the line at a particular industry such as the airlines is likely to blunt the spur that the proper amount of leverage provides both to equity markets and economic efficiency in general
far better for policy makers to concentrate on the war against drugs panama and the deficit all of them parades that seem never to end

tokyo share prices rebounded tuesday morning with the nikkei index of 225 selected stocks rising 618.69 points to close the morning session at 35087.38
the index slid 647.33 points or 1.8 % on monday
in the first 25 minutes of tuesday 's trading the nikkei index soared 664.83 points to 35133.83
by 10 a.m. tokyo time the index was up 435.11 points to 34903.80 as investors hailed new york 's overnight rally
monday 's slide came in a relatively calm session that did n't provide much direction for other markets
shares also closed sharply lower across europe particularly in frankfurt although london and a few other markets recovered some ground after stocks began to rebound in new york
other asian and pacific markets had sharper losses than tokyo but the selling wave stopped short of precipitating another market crash
all eyes were on tokyo at the opening because it was the first major market to trade since friday 's 190.58-point plunge on wall street
but rather than set the tone for other markets japan 's major institutional investors chose to remain on the sidelines
still despite the sudden reappearance of stock-market turbulence managers of japanese investment funds said they were n't planning to unload u.s. or european equities
we did n't trade much today as our policy now is to wait and see said a fund manager at taisho life insurance co
we would like to wait and see until trading goes around through europe and new york
the institutions appeared confident that japanese regulators would step in to ensure orderly trading if necessary and there was considerable speculation during the day that the finance ministry was working behind the scenes to do just that
but in the absence of panicky trading its presence was never overtly felt
at the close the nikkei average of 225 stocks stood at 34468.69 down 647.33 points or 1.8 %
the broader tokyo stock price index sank 45.66 or 1.7 % to 2600.88
the day 's decline was generally in line with analysts ' weekend predictions
declining issues swamped advancers 941-105
but volume was thin at 526.2 million shares compared with 574.7 million friday
the market opened sharply lower with the nikkei average down nearly 600 after 20 minutes
a midmorning rebound brought it back to show a gain of about 200 at the end of the morning session but the rally failed in the afternoon and the market closed near the day 's low
the smaller stocks in the tokyo market 's second section also posted their biggest decline of the year
the tokyo stock exchange index for the second section fell 100.96 or 2.7 % to 3655.40
many investors trying to outperform the market 's major indexes have flocked to these small issues in recent weeks
japanese investors and traders expressed relief that the tokyo market did n't fall more sharply
but its performance did bear some resemblance to events of two years ago during the october 1987 global stock market crash
on oct. 16 1987 the friday before the black monday crash the new york market dropped 4.6 % and tokyo followed on monday with a 2.4 % drop
this time wall street 's plunge of 6.9 % friday was followed by yesterday 's 1.8 % loss in tokyo
two years ago tokyo 's biggest fall came the day after new york 's 22.6 % black monday plunge when the nikkei average fell 14.9 %
thus market participants yesterday were looking ahead nervously to wall street 's opening
but in new york yesterday the dow jones industrial average surged 88.12 to close at 2657.38 on heavy volume of 416,290,000 shares although declining issues still outnumbered advancing ones on the broad market
nobuto yasuda a director at yamaichi investment trust & management co. called yesterday 's session a good scenario for japan
now we are looking for the time to place buy orders he said
for us institutional investors the chance for buying has come
isao ushikubo general manager of the investment research department at toyo trust & banking co. also was optimistic
he described friday 's plunge in the u.s. as a fleeting event resulting in part from excessive merger and acquisition activity
unless there is a panic this is the best time to buy as was the case two years ago he said
those shares which had posted gains on m&a speculation were dashed with cold water but as far as major stocks are concerned there is n't much impact
other fund managers were similarly sanguine
we have no plans to adjust our asset allocation in foreign equities said masato murakami chief portfolio manager in the pension fund management department at yasuda trust & banking co
he said friday 's wall street decline was well within the range of volatility that yasuda trust plans for when it charts its overseas investment strategy
among other asian and pacific markets malaysia and singapore had the biggest losses with the kuala lumpur composite index in malaysia falling 11.5 % and singapore 's straits times industrial index down 10 %
major indexes declined more than 8 % in australia and new zealand and 6.5 % in hong kong
bangkok manila seoul taipei and jakarta escaped with slightly smaller losses
brokers and fund managers said the region 's markets were reacting to friday 's wall street plunge even though that decline was due to local factors such as failed corporate buy-outs and a deteriorating junk-bond market
it 's pure psychology said william au yeung an account executive for drexel burnham lambert hk ltd. in hong kong
markets in this region are n't so geared to leveraged buy-outs and their economies generally are in good shape but there 's no doubt that asia is still following america 's lead
several analysts said malaysia and singapore had the biggest losses because they are relatively open to rapid cash flows
hong kong is the region 's next most open market but many foreign investors have been staying away from it since it plunged in june amid political turmoil in china
singapore took the hit because when people want to get out they tend to go where the liquidity is said elizabeth hambrecht a regional analyst with baring securities hong kong ltd
she pointed out that even after monday 's 10 % decline the straits times index is up 24 % this year so investors who bailed out generally did so profitably
similarly kuala lumpur 's composite index yesterday ended 27.5 % above its 1988 close
in hong kong the hang seng index fell 180.60 to finish at 2601.70
trading was heavy at about one billion shares compared with 473.9 million friday
but the session was orderly in contrast to the market 's four-day closure after the 1987 crash
richard chenevix-trench a director at hong kong-based baring international fund managers ltd. said the market probably has n't hit bottom yet but is close
if new york does n't collapse i see maybe another 5 % on the downside not counting the risk of bad news out of china he said
in australia sydney 's all ordinaries index closed at 1601.5 down 8.1 % its biggest drop since october 1987
but volume rose only to 162 million shares from 143 million friday
nestor hinzack an analyst at brokerage firm burdett buckeridge & young ltd. described the market 's performance as sheep-like as investors fled to bluechip australian stocks and shunned entrepreneurial companies they perceived as having any takeover premium built into the price
london 's financial times-stock exchange 100-share index the most closely watched market barometer ended at its intraday high of 2163.4 down 70.5 or 3.2 %
at its low shortly before wall street opened it was off more than 130 points
the financial times 30-share index closed 79.3 points lower at 1738.7
volume more than doubled to 959.3 million shares from 457.7 million friday
prices on the frankfurt stock exchange tumbled in heavy trading
the decline in the german stock index of 203.56 points or 12.8 % to 1385.72 was the frankfurt market 's steepest fall ever
retail investors dumped holdings on a massive scale pushing some blue-chip shares down as much as 20 %
analysts cited memories of two years ago when many small investors held on to their shares after the october crash but the west german market continued to decline steeply for the next three months
here are price trends on the world 's major stock markets as calculated by morgan stanley capital international perspective geneva
to make them directly comparable each index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100
the percentage change is since year-end
frank lloyd wright is reported to have said once that if you tipped the world on its side everything loose would end up in california
we 've always thought that mr. wright underestimated california 's vitality but maybe the state 's la-la factions are starting to overwhelm the forces that made it such a significant place
what else is one to make of the whacky save-the-earth initiative just proposed by several major environmental groups and organized by the state 's attorney general
if passed by the voters the recently announced initiative would phase out major pesticides reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 40 % ban new offshore drilling ban chemicals thought to deplete the ozone layer and create a new state environmental officer armed with a $ 40 million budget to sue any firm or agency he thinks is being too dirty
the initiative is based largely on the wish-lists of the green lobby the sierra club the league of conservation voters the natural resources defense council the national toxics campaign and the citizens for a better environment
interestingly the environmental defense fund is having nothing to do with this one
not only californians but all americans would pay if this thing passed
the initiative bars the sale of any crops in california that do n't meet the initiative 's standards
kansas wheat farmers and florida fruit growers would have to adjust or give up the california market
in other words california is presuming to take control of the nation 's farm policy
as usual the green lobby 's proposal is disconnected from scientific reality
consider the greenhouse-effect provision
the proposed initiative would mandate a reduction of carbon dioxide of 40 %
even if one buys into the whole greenhouse theory it is inconceivable that reductions in a single state could have any impact on what is billed as a global problem
but if rational science and economics have nothing to do with the new environment initiative what is going on
the first place to look under these circumstances is at the ways in which the sponsors themselves will benefit
the key here is the ambition of state attorney general john van de kamp
he 's running for governor
mr. van de kamp is the one who collected the plans from the various radical environmental groups and cobbled them into a single unwieldy initiative to be placed on the ballot for election on nov. 6 1990
that 's also the day of the gubernatorial election
the initiative seems to have been crafted to include all the hot issues that set off the wealthy hollywood weepers who donate money
and it allows mr. van de kamp to get around campaign spending limits
he can spend the legal maximum for his campaign all the spending for the van de kamp initiative on which there are no limits is gravy
this initiative is being labeled the big green but maybe it should be called the big greenback
the republican candidate sen. pete wilson is playing the initiative fundraising game too sponsoring his own crime initiative
while it is possible that the big green initiative will be ruled unconstitutional it is of course conceivable that in modern california it could slide through
this is the state that recently passed the prop. 65 anti-toxic initiative
if this new proposal ever does become law the green lobby will benefit directly
the initiative creates a free floating state environmental officer to sue companies or government agencies that do things he does n't like
that means the nrdc and such groups no longer would have to spend as much money on litigation taxpayers would bear the cost
mr. van de kamp and his allies may be hoping that the environment is such a mom and apple-pie issue among certain segments of california 's population now that almost any collection of anti-scientific anti-pocketbook nonsense can pass under its rubric
of course the state 's liberals are not yet a nation unto themselves
george bush for example may decide that he does n't want to be the president who lost control of interstate commerce to an attorney general from california
and some other segments of california 's political and media culture may yet start to point out that the initiative would impose significant costs on the state 's less affluent citizens in the form of higher food prices and lost jobs
this grandiose initiative will help california define itself for the future either as a state still tethered to economic and scientific reality or as one being led to wherever its la-la activists want to take it
first there was a death watch
then exhilaration
spurred by waves of large-scale buying in blue-chip stocks the dow jones industrial average rallied yesterday and erased about a half of friday 's 190.58-point plunge gaining 88.12 to 2657.38
it was the fourth-biggest advance for the average of 30 blue chips on frenetic new york stock exchange volume of 416,290,000 shares the highest since the days after the 1987 crash
while the advance cheered investors who feared a 1987-style crash would occur yesterday it was strictly a big-stock rally fed by huge buying by bargain-hunting institutions and program traders
a troubling sign declining stocks on the big board outnumbered advancers 975 to 749 and the over-the-counter market that includes many smaller stocks suffered aftershocks of friday 's late big board plunge
the nasdaq otc index closed down 6.31 to 460.98
meanwhile in a divergence in two of the market 's most important indicators the dow industrials ' sister average the 20-stock dow jones transportation average tumbled 102.06 to 1304.23 its second-worst decline next to the 164.78-point fall during the 1987 crash
transports plunged on takeover disappointments in two airline stocks ual and amr which each fell more than 20 % when they reopened for trading yesterday after being suspended friday afternoon
ual the takeover stock at the center of friday 's 190.58-point market plunge fell 56 7/8 to 222 7/8 on nearly 2.3 million shares
overall this is a pleasant rally but it 's very selective said arthur cashin jr. a veteran painewebber inc. trader at the big board
everyone was a little concerned about the general narrowness of the rally and failure of the otc market to get into plus territory
it 's just a strange feeling
i do n't think anyone left the place whistling dixie
the rally gave credence at least for now to the pre-trading declaration of big board chairman john j. phelan jr. that friday 's market debacle was an abnormal condition and not a disaster
but to traders it looked like disaster on the 9:30 a.m. opening bell
the dow jones industrial average opened down 1.64 shortly after 9:30
but most of the 30 blue-chip stocks in the average including eastman kodak and general motors could n't trade because of the heavy backlog of sell orders left over from friday 's late-afternoon rout
at 9:45 procter & gamble one of the most important dow bellwethers of late opened down 2 3/4 to 117
the dow dropped to a quick 27-point loss and to many traders it looked as if stocks were headed for yet another big tumble
more stocks opened over the ensuing half hour as the 49 big board specialist firms in charge of keeping the market orderly groped to find buy orders from major brokerage firms to match the selling flood
then to make matters worse computerized sell programs kicked in hammering stocks into steeper losses
there was heavy stock-index arbitrage as traders sold big baskets of stock and bought stock-index futures to profit from the price discrepancies between the two markets
this was a hangover from friday when standard & poor 's 500-stock index futures had closed at a sharp discount to stocks
the onslaught of the program selling dashed any hopes that some of the big program trading firms would hold off until the market stabilized
they did n't
the dow accelerated its slide losing 63.52 in the first 40 minutes of trading
with program traders seemingly in charge buyers backed away from the market and watched stocks fall
then at 10:15 the dow suddenly started to rebound and when it shot upward it did so even faster than the early-morning fall
and this time it was n't just the program traders who were responsible
all the selling had pushed stocks to such cheap values that big investment banks and major money management firms started buying stocks heavily
the program traders were in there too of course
but according to one trader the programmers did n't look as dominant on the upside as on the downside because there was also a lot of bargain-hunting by institutions
roland m. machold director of the new jersey division of investment which oversees $ 29 billion in investments said the first thing we did was to double our orders yesterday morning
with the market down like this we 'll probably take another $ 50 million and put it in the market
trading in walt disney co. particularly caught traders ' eyes
according to big board officials disney had one of the biggest sell-order imbalances on friday it was one of the seven stocks that could n't finish trading that day
the stock opened late at 114 1/2 down 8 1/2
but then it shot upward 7 1/2 as goldman sachs & co. stepped in and bought traders said
however disney specialist robert fagenson said i would be surprised if goldman represented 4 % of the opening volume
around wall street trading desks were relieved that they could at least play the market yesterday in contrast to friday 's gridlock
at donaldson lufkin & jenrette inc. head equity trader dudley eppel said i think the opening was constructive
it was orderly
we put some orders together
there was n't a lot of panic selling either domestically or internationally
not like friday where they just took the market apart
still the market had n't yet crossed into positive territory and traders were glum
but in another dramatic burst the dow tacked on 42 points in five minutes and at 10:25 the index showed a gain of 5.74
on the big board floor and on trading desks traders yelped their approval
grinned griffith peck a trader in shearson lehman hutton inc. 's otc department i tell you this market acts healthy
around him scores of traders seemed to get a burst of energy their boss broke out bottles of perrier water to cool them off
among big board specialists the cry was pull your offers meaning that specialists soon expected to get higher prices for their shares
it was bedlam on the upside said one big board specialist
but not everybody was making money
the carnage on the chicago board options exchange the nation 's major options market was heavy after the trading in s&p 100 stock-index options was halted friday
many market makers in the s&p 100 index options contract had bullish positions friday and when the shutdown came they were frozen with huge losses
over the weekend clearing firms told the chicago market makers to get out of their positions at any cost monday morning
they were absolutely killed slaughtered said one chicago-based options trader
some traders said that the closely watched major market index whose 20 stocks mimic the dow industrials did n't lead yesterday 's big rally
james gallagher a partner at specialist fowler & rosenau said the difference between today and two years ago terrible tuesday oct. 20 1987 is that then we needed a savior to go into the major market index spend $ 2 million and get the program rally started
this time institutions saw the programs coming and backed away and backed away
then when the market was at a technical level to buy they came in with a vengeance
however according to one analyst the timing of major market index futures buying just before the turnaround was similar to that of terrible tuesday
futures were pulling the stock market higher said donald selkin head of stock-index futures research at prudential-bache securities inc
although the big board 's specialist firms struggled through another highly volatile trading session their performance yesterday was better than during friday 's late-afternoon chaos according to traders and brokers who work with them
specialists were criticized for their inability to maintain orderly markets during the friday plunge
but yesterday even with halts in such major blue-chip stocks as merck we expected the halts and it was n't too bad said donaldson 's mr. eppel who had been critical of the specialists ' performance on friday
according to a big board official while many stocks opened late there were subsequent trading halts in only three issues amr merck and valero energy
merck is one of the most important stocks in the major market index
no sector of the market has been spared during the past two days ' gyrations
yet from the dow industrials ' high on oct. 9 through friday 's plunge relatively good performances have been turned in by real-estate utilities precious metals and life insurance stocks
and yesterday the top performing industry group was oil field equipment issues
for example halliburton jumped 3 1/4 to 38 schlumberger rose 2 1/2 to 43 1/4 and baker hughes rose 1 1/8 to 22
because of the ual and amr tumbles airlines were the weakest sector of the market yesterday
philip morris was the big board 's most active issue rising 2 1/4 to 43 1/4 on nearly eight million shares
among other major issues coca-cola co. closed up 2 at 66 3/4 on 1.7 million shares and american telephone & telegraph rose 3 1/4 to 43 on nearly 7.8 million shares
shares of international business machines which reported earnings yesterday finished at 103 up 1 after slipping below 100 during friday 's session for the first time in five years
shares of three brokerage firms rose after they reported earnings
merrill lynch added 1 3/4 to 28 painewebber rose 3/4 to 18 1/2 and bear stearns rose 3/8 to 14 1/4
federal national mortgage association a recently hot stock climbed 4 to 124 on nearly 1.6 million shares
at a news conference after the close of trading yesterday the big board 's mr. phelan and other exchange officials praised the performance of their computers and personnel
mr. phelan said that program trading strategies were n't responsible for triggering friday 's decline despite a jump in the use of the computer-driven strategies in recent months
some 24 million of the more than 100 million shares traded in the final 90 minutes of friday 's session when the plunge in stock prices was concentrated were program-related he said
program trades make up 10 % of the exchange 's volume on an average day but despite the increase friday it was certainly not something you would say precipitated the market decline mr. phelan said
mr. phelan expressed relief that the market rebounded yesterday
obviously every time we get this kind of reaction it 's going to make everybody nervous including me he said
he said that exchange officials had conversations with wall street firms throughout the weekend and that all the participants behaved very very responsibly today
meanwhile peter dapuzzo shearson 's head of retail equity trading praised institutional investors in the otc market who were heavy buyers of the nasdaq 's biggest technology issues yesterday amid a flood of selling by other investors
the institutions ca n't be criticized for their behavior mr. dapuzzo said in an interview
it was the opposite of what happened on oct. 19
they used their judgment
they did n't panic during the first round of selling this morning
instead they bought on weakness and sold into the strength which kept the market orderly
maybe they learned from experience
mr. phelan said the performance of specialists during friday 's plunge was admirable because out of 1,640 big board common stocks traded during the day only seven were closed and were n't reopened before the close
they did an excellent job mr. phelan said of the specialists
wall street traders on friday had complained about the trading suspensions

nasa should now sue for fines against all three politico-plaintiffs foreign and domestic for bringing this mischievous case
a house-senate conference approved a permanent smoking ban on all domestic airline routes within the continental u.s. and on all flights of six hours or less to alaska and hawaii
the restrictions would cover all but a small percentage of domestic air traffic and represent a major expansion of the current smoking ban on flights of two hours or less
the exemption allowed on longer flights to alaska and hawaii appears to be largely a face-saving concession for the traditionally powerful tobacco industry which has found itself increasingly isolated in the face of public pressure in recent years
by a 6-4 margin house negotiators initially rejected last night a senate provision covering all domestic flights
but the six-hour compromise was soon agreed to in subsequent discussions
as a practical matter flights from the west coast to hawaii would be covered as they are under the time limit but the language would exempt longer routes beginning for example in chicago or on the east coast
within the senate the ban has had aggressive support from sen. frank lautenberg d. n.j. who has used his position as a senate appropriations subcommittee chairman to garner votes for the initiative
the measure is attached to the more than $ 26 billion fiscal 1990 transportation bill within mr. lautenberg 's jurisdiction and the final compromise is laced with more than $ 205 million in road projects earmarked by members as well as funds sought by major airports including denver
from the outset the tobacco industry has been uncertain as to what strategy to follow
but the industry retains support in the house leadership through the influence of grower states such as north carolina
majority whip william gray owes a political debt to southern agriculture lawmakers for his rise in the house and the philadelphia democrat used his position in the conference to salvage the exemption from a total ban
although the smoking provision has attracted the most public interest the underlying bill was the subject of behind-the-scenes lobbying because of its impact on air transportation and the more mundane but politically important projects of members
in a stark lesson in the power of the appropriations committees the house deliberately killed a handful of projects backed by lawmakers in florida illinois and pennsylvania who had voted against the panel leadership on the house floor
anybody can vote as they want said rep. william lehman d. fla. head of the house conferees
but if you make a request you should support the committee
within the federal aviation administration the final bill promises to increase spending for facilities and equipment by more than 20 % from last year and total operations would rise to $ 3.84 billion a 12 % boost
the facilities account includes $ 40 million for denver 's ambitious new airport and the competition for these funds created shifting alliances between urban lawmakers representing established airports in philadelphia and michigan and the major carriers to denver united and continental
leery of the costs and critics say competition the airlines have sought to gain leverage over the city of denver
texas air corp. which owns continental and the air transport association were prominent in the lobbying
the industry sought to impose conditions that would have delayed funds for the project until denver and the airlines had agreed to leases for 50 % of the gates
but this was rejected in favor of much looser language directing the transportation department to review the costs of the first phase expected to cost about $ 2 billion
though smaller in total dollars the conference agreed to preserve an estimated $ 30.6 million in controversial subsidies to carriers serving rural or isolated airports
the sum is more than double what the house had approved for the program but the list of qualified airports would be cut by 22 under new distance requirements and limits on the level of subsidy
congress previously cut six airports this year
the impact of the changes is to eliminate many of the most excessive cases where the government has been paying more than $ 200 for each passenger in subsidies

enjoying several blockbuster movie hits including batman los angeles-based guber-peters entertainment co. reported earnings for the first quarter ended aug. 31 of $ 5.8 million or 50 cents a share compared with a year-earlier loss
sony corp. which has offered to acquire the movie-production company is seeking to free its top executives peter guber and jon peters from an exclusive agreement with time warner inc. 's warner communications inc. so they can run columbia pictures entertainment inc
sony two weeks ago agreed to acquire columbia for $ 3.4 billion or $ 27 a share
warner sued sony and guber-peters late last week sony and guber-peters have countersued charging warner with attempting to interfere in sony 's acquisition of the two companies
guber-peters 's net income in the latest quarter compared with a net loss of $ 6.9 million or 62 cents a share in the year-earlier period
the company said revenue rose 138 % to $ 10.9 million from $ 4.6 million reflecting the success of its movies gorillas in the mist and rainman as well as the box-office smash batman

in a filing with the securities and exchange commission the huntsman group said it controls 2,720,675 aristech common shares including 306,000 shares bought from aug. 21 to oct. 13 for $ 20 to $ 20.875 per share

congress has been critical of the bush administration for not sending enough aid to poland so it is getting ready to send its own version of a care package
last month the senate voted to send a delegation of congressional staffers to poland to assist its legislature the sejm in democratic procedures
senator pete domenici calls this effort the first gift of democracy
the poles might do better to view it as a trojan horse
it is the vast shadow government of 15,000 congressional staffers that helps create such legislative atrocities as the 1,376 page 13-pound reconciliation bill that claimed to be the budget of the united states
maybe after the staffers explain their work to the poles they 'd be willing to come back and do the same for the american people
waterford wedgwood plc a financially troubled irish maker of fine crystal and wedgwood china reported that its pretax loss for the first six months widened to 10.6 million irish punts $ 14.9 million from 5.8 million irish punts a year earlier
the results for the half were worse than market expectations which suggested an interim loss of around 10 million irish punts
in a sharply weaker london market yesterday waterford shares were down 15 pence at 50 pence 79 cents
the company reported a loss after taxation and minority interests of 14 million irish punts compared with a loss of 9.3 million irish punts for the year-earlier period
there were n't any extraordinary items
sales for the total group rose 27 % to 168.1 million irish punts compared with 132.6 million irish punts a year ago
waterford has decided against paying an interim dividend
waterford said the appointment of a new management team and the signing of a comprehensive labor agreement are expected to enhance the company 's long-term prospects
the sudden flight to quality that triggered friday 's explosive bond-market rally was reversed yesterday in a flight from quality rout
the setback in which treasury bond prices plummeted reflected a rebound in the stock market and profit-taking
it was a pretty wild day
our markets were closely tied to the stock market said joel kazis manager of trading at smith barney harris upham & co
friday 's flight to quality was no longer needed once the stock market found its legs he said
some fixed-income investors had expected a further drop in stock prices after the nearly 200-point drop in the dow jones industrial average on friday
that caused investors to flee stocks and buy high-quality treasury bonds which are safer than other types of securities
but when stocks began to climb instead prices of treasury bonds declined
contributing to the selling pressure were dispatches by several investment firms advising clients to boost their stock holdings and reduce the size of their cash or bond portfolios
among the firms were merrill lynch & co. and dean witter reynolds inc
the bond market seemed to ignore evidence that the federal reserve eased credit conditions slightly by allowing the federal funds rate to drift as low as 8 1/2 %
the closely watched rate on federal funds or overnight loans between banks slid to about 8 3/4 % last week down from its perceived target level of about 9 %
the rate is considered an early signal of changes in fed policy
traders said yesterday 's modest easing did n't stir much enthusiasm because it had been widely expected
in fact some economists contend that the latest easing started last week
others note that some investors were disappointed because they had expected a more aggressive easing
the treasury 's benchmark 30-year bond ended about 1 3/4 points lower or down about $ 17.50 for each $ 1,000 face amount
the reversal was even more evident among shorter-term treasury securities
after treasury bill rates plummeted as much as 0.70 percentage point on friday they gave back three-fourths of that amount yesterday
the bond-equivalent yield on three-month treasury bills for example was quoted late yesterday at 7.72 % compared with 7.16 % friday
investment-grade corporate bonds mortgage-backed securities and municipal bonds also fell
but prices of junk bonds which were battered friday in near standstill trading rebounded to post small gains after a volatile trading session
junk bonds opened as much as four points lower but staged a modest comeback as stock prices firmed
some traders said the high-yield market was helped by active institutional buying
in particular they said firms such as first boston corp. and drexel burnham lambert inc. began making a market in junk issues early in the session when prices hit severely depressed levels
i think the willingness of securities companies to make markets for high-yield issues improved the sentiment for junk bonds said john lonski an economist at moody 's investors service inc
u.s. treasury bonds were higher in overnight trading in japan which opened at about 7:30 p.m. edt
the benchmark 30-year bond for example rose one point in early japanese trading in reaction to a quick 600-point drop in the tokyo stock market
but as japanese stocks rebounded treasurys retreated and ended just modestly higher
many u.s. trading operations wanting to keep a watchful eye on japanese trading as an indication of where u.s. trading would begin were fully staffed during the tokyo trading session
most of the action was during the night session said michael moore trading manager at continental bank
jay goldinger who often trades overnight for capital insight inc. beverly hills calif. said trading in tokyo was very active but highly volatile
we went down 3/4 point in 10 minutes right before lunch then after lunch we went up 3/4 point in 12 minutes he said
in tokyo trading is halted during lunchtime
tokyo 's market turned out to be a bad bellwether for u.s. trading
when the market opened here bonds prices fell as the stock market regained strength
the bond market 's focus on stock activity was so strong yesterday that it overshadowed today 's slate of economic data which includes the government 's report on august u.s. merchandise trade and september industrial production
industrial production is expected to have declined 0.2 % according to a consensus of economists surveyed by dow jones capital markets report
the august trade deficit is expected to have widened to $ 9.1 billion from $ 7.58 billion in july
a widening of that magnitude said one new york trader is not a favorable number
it could do damage to us
meanwhile agency supply is expected to weigh heavily on the market today when the federal home loan bank prices a $ 2.3 billion offering of one-year three-year five-year and 10-year maturities
tomorrow the resolution funding corp. will provide details of its first bond issue which is expected to total between $ 4 billion and $ 6 billion and carry a maturity greater than 20 years
resolution funding is a division of resolution trust corp. the new federal agency created to bail out the nation 's troubled thrifts
and this week the tennessee valley authority plans to price a $ 3 billion offering its first public debt borrowing in 15 years
there 's lots of supply the new york trader said
we have a couple or three tough weeks coming
treasury securities
prices of treasury bonds tumbled in moderate to active trading
the benchmark 30-year treasury bond was quoted late at a price of 101 19/32 compared with a closing price of 103 12/32 friday
the yield on the benchmark issue rose to 7.97 % from 7.82 %
the latest 10-year notes were quoted late at 100 3/32 for a yield of 7.97 % compared with 101 9/32 to yield 7.84 %
short-term interest rates fell yesterday at the government 's weekly treasury bill auction
the average discount rate on new three-month treasury bills was 7.37 % the lowest since the average of 7.36 % at the auction on oct. 17 1988
the average discount rate was 7.42 % on new six-month bills the lowest since the average of 7.35 % at the auction on july 31 1989
here are auction details
rates are determined by the difference between the purchase price and face value
thus higher bidding narrows the investor 's return while lower bidding widens it

what does n't belong here
a. manual typewriters b. black-and-white snapshots c. radio adventure shows
if you guessed black-and-white snapshots you 're right
after years of fading into the background two-tone photography is coming back
trendy magazine advertisements feature stark black-and-white photos of hollywood celebrities pitching jeans shoes and liquor
portrait studios accustomed to shooting only in color report a rush to black-and-white portrait orders
and black-and-white photography classes are crowded with students
what 's happening in photography mirrors the popularity of black and white in fashion home furnishings and cinematography
on seventh avenue designers have been advancing the monochrome look with clothing collections done entirely in black and white
and classic black-and-white movies are enjoying a comeback on videocassette tapes spurred in part by the backlash against colorization of old films
the pendulum is swinging back to black and white says richard demoulin the general manager of eastman kodak co. 's professional photography division
until two years ago sales of black-and-white film had been declining steadily since the 1960s
but last year buoyed by increased use in advertising and other commercial applications sales increased 5 % and they are expected to jump at least that much again this year
photographic companies are scrambling to tap the resurging market reviving some black-and-white product lines and developing new ones
at kodak which largely ignored the market for years black-and-white film sales now account for nearly 15 % of the company 's $ 3 billion in film and paper sales annually up from 10 % three years ago
the rochester n.y. photographic giant recently began marketing t-max 3200 one of the fastest and most sensitive monochrome films
aimed at commercial photographers the film can be used in very low light without sacrificing quality says donald franz of photofinishing newsletter
also trying to snare a portion of the $ 2 billion-a-year industry is agfa corp. a unit of bayer ag
agfa recently signed olympic gold medalist florence griffith-joyner to endorse a new line of black-and-white paper that 's geared to consumers and will compete directly with kodak 's papers
slated for market by the end of the year the paper could have been introduced a long time ago but the market was n't there then says an agfa spokesman
the biggest beneficiary of the black-and-white revival is likely to be international paper co. 's ilford division known in the industry for its premium products
sales of ilford 's four varieties of black-and-white film this year are outpacing growth in the overall market although the company wo n't say by exactly how much
we hope the trend lasts says laurie dicara ilford 's marketing communications director
why all the interest
for baby boomers who grew up being photographed in color black and white seems eye-catching and exotic
it has an archival almost nostalgic quality to it says owen b. butler the chairman of the applied photography department at rochester institute of technology
you can shift out of reality with black and white he adds
such features have been especially attractive to professional photographers and marketing executives who have been steadily increasing their use of black and white in advertising
processing of black-and-white commercial film jumped 24 % last year to 18.7 million rolls
consider gap inc. whose latest ad campaign features black-and-white shots of hollywood stars artists and other well-known personalities modeling the retailer 's jeans and t-shirts
richard crisman the account manager for the campaign says gap did n't intentionally choose black and white to distinguish its ads from the color spreads of competitors
we wanted to highlight the individual not the environment he says and black and white allows you to do that better than color
the campaign won a cleo award as this year 's best ad by a specialty retailer
even food products and automobiles which have long depended on color are making the switch
companies feel black and white will convey a stronger statement says marc l. hauser a chicago photographer who is working on a black-and-white print ad for stouffer food corp. 's lean cuisine
other companies that are currently using two-tone ads include american express co. and epson america inc
portrait studios have also latched onto the trend
using black and white we can make housewives look like stars says john perrin
his on-broadway photography studio in portland ore. doubled its business last year and he says is booked solid for the next five
one customer dayna brunsdon says she spurned a color portrait for black and white because it 's more dramatic
i show it to my friends and they all say wow
it is n't ordinary like color
still most consumers are n't plunking black-and-white film into their cameras to take family snapshots
one big obstacle is that few drugstores develop the film anymore
typically it must be mailed to a handful of processors and may take a week or more to be processed and returned
black-and-white film costs consumers a little less than color film and processing costs the same
but for photofinishers developing costs for black-and-white film are higher
some companies are starting to tackle that problem
ilford for example recently introduced a black-and-white film that can be processed quickly by color labs
intent on wooing customers the company is also increasing its sponsorship of black-and-white photography classes
similarly agfa is sponsoring scores of photography contests at high schools and colleges offering free black-and-white film and paper as prizes
and kodak is distributing an instructional video to processors on how to develop its monochrome film more efficiently
other companies are introducing related products
charles beseler co. a leading maker of photographic enlargers introduced last month a complete darkroom starter kit targeted at teen-agers who want to process their own black-and-white photographs
the kit which has a suggested retail price of $ 250 and has already become a bestseller was introduced after retailers noticed numerous requests from parents for children 's photography equipment
it seems computers as hobbies have waned says ian brightman beseler 's chairman and chief executive officer
but some industry observers believe the resurgence of black and white is only a fad
they cite the emergence of still electronic photography more newspapers turning to color on their pages and measurable improvements in the quality of color prints
black and white has n't made the same quantum leaps in technological development as color says mr. butler of the rochester institute
the color print today is far superior to prints of 10 years ago
you ca n't say the same with black and white
but when popular photography a leading magazine for photographers selected 15 of the greatest photos ever made for its latest issue celebrating photography 's 150th anniversary all were black and white
it 's got a classic spirit and carries over emotionally says alfred debat of professional photographers of america
that 's the appeal
mcclatchy newspapers inc. said improvements in advertising and subscription revenue led to a 21 % gain in third-quarter profit to $ 8.8 million or 31 cents a share from $ 7.2 million or 25 cents a share
sales rose more than 7 % to $ 94.9 million from $ 88.3 million
the sacramento calif. company also attributed improved performance to a lower effective tax rate and higher interest income
for the nine months the newspaper chain had almost a 23 % increase in profit to $ 23.6 million or 83 cents a share from $ 19.2 million or 68 cents a share
sales grew almost 7 % to $ 279.1 million from $ 261.3 million
mcclatchy publishes the sacramento calif. bee and tacoma wash. news tribune and other papers in western states
in composite trading on the new york stock exchange the company closed at $ 25.25 a share down 25 cents

those two offers were private and the spokesman refused to identify the bidding companies
the spokesman further said that at least two more offers are expected from other companies within two weeks
gatoil suisse owns an oil refinery in switzerland with a capacity of 70,000 barrels a day along with a network of gasoline retailing outlets
while friday 's plunging stock market prompted new fears about the economy 's prospects a little-known indicator that has faithfully foreshadowed the economy 's ups and downs by exceptionally long lead times points to a sustained rise in overall business activity
the barometer developed by analysts at columbia university 's center for international business cycle research here reached a record high of 223.0 in august the latest month available and the columbia researchers estimate that it has moved even higher since then
the latest reading of 223.0 was up from 222.3 in july and 215.3 as recently as march
the august rise marked the fifth straight monthly gain for the indicator which uses the 1967 average as a base of 100
in contrast the commerce department 's widely followed index of leading indicators while up in august has fallen repeatedly since reaching a high early this year
its ragged behavior through much of 1989 has prompted some forecasters to anticipate the start of a new recession perhaps before year 's end
but the far stronger showing of the columbia index makes a recession any time soon highly unlikely says geoffrey h. moore the director of the columbia facility
a leading authority on the business cycle mr. moore also is a member of the business cycle dating group the panel of private economists that decides for the government when expansions and recessions begin and end
the group normally convenes only when a change in the economy 's general course seems likely
no meeting is scheduled because the expansion shows no sign of going off the tracks mr. moore reports
based largely on the recent strength in their index called the long leading indicator the columbia analysts foresee uninterrupted economic growth through the rest of this year and next year as well
they expect a 2.6 % rise in 1990 in the gross national product after adjustment for inflation
underlying this optimism is the index 's longstanding ability to signal recessions or recoveries as the case may be by substantially greater periods than the commerce department 's index of leading indicators
over the full post-world war ii era the columbia index on the average has entered sustained declines 14 months before the onset of recessions and turned up eight months before recoveries
the comparable lead times for the commerce index whose components include the stock market are far shorter 10 months before recessions and only three months before recoveries
the columbia economists also have reconstructed how the long leading index would have behaved had it existed in 1929 before the stock market crash in october that ushered in the great depression
the indicator reached a peak in january 1929 and then fell steadily up to and through the crash
it was an entirely different pattern from what we 're seeing now mr. moore says
a major source of the recent strength in the long leading indicator has been the performance of the dow jones corporate bond-price index which is not a part of the commerce index
in august the bond measure was at its highest monthly average since early 1987
it also rose last friday while the stock market sagged
other components of the long leading indicator include a ratio of prices to unit labor costs in manufacturing industries the m2 version of the money supply adjusted for inflation and the volume of new home-building permits
notably absent from the columbia index is the stock market which mr. moore says is simply no longer such a good indicator of the economy 's long-range prospects though it still is useful for anticipating some short-run twists and turns
as recently as 1975 the stock market as reflected in the standard & poor 's index of 500 common stocks was rated by the national bureau of economic research as the best of the 12 leading indicators that then made up the commerce index
it was assigned a mark of 80 out of a possible 100 compared with scores ranging as low as 69 for the other components
the stock market has lost some precursory power analysts at the columbia center claim because of the growing impact of international developments
stocks have become more sensitive to factors not directly tied to the domestic economy mr. moore says citing the exchange rate for the dollar on currency markets the foreign-trade balance and inflows of foreign capital
he also feels that the rise of such computer-based practices as program trading has diminished the stock market 's relevancy to the economic outlook
bsn s.a. a leading french food group said it agreed to acquire birkel g.m.b.h. a west german pasta maker
the value of the acquisition was n't disclosed
the move is in line with bsn 's strategy of gradually building its share of the european pasta market through external growth
bsn will initially acquire a 15 % interest in birkel a closely held concern
the french group has an agreement giving it the right to buy all the shares outstanding and this could be completed within a few months a bsn spokeswoman said

an american journalist now is standing trial in namibia
this is the place that world opinion has been celebrating over in the expectation that it 's going to hold an election
the most likely winner will be the marxist-dominated swapo rebels
the u.s. journalist 's crime was writing that the head of the commission charged with overseeing the election 's fairness bryan o'linn was openly sympathetic to swapo
shortly after that mr. o'linn had scott stanley arrested and his passport confiscated
mr. stanley is on trial over charges that he violated a proclamation issued by the south african administrator general earlier this year which made it a crime punishable by two years in prison for any person to insult disparate or belittle the election commission
the stanley affair does n't bode well for the future of democracy or freedom of anything in namibia when swapo starts running the government
to the extent mr. stanley has done anything wrong it may be that he is out of step with the consensus of world intellectuals that the namibian guerrillas were above all else the victims of suppression by neighboring south africa
swapo has enjoyed favorable western media treatment ever since the u.n. general assembly declared it the sole authentic representative of namibia 's people in
last year the u.s. brokered a peace settlement to remove cuba 's afrika korps from angola and hold free and fair elections that would end south africa 's control of namibia
the elections are set for nov. 7
in july mr. stanley editor of american press international a washington d.c.-based conservative wire service visited namibia to report on the u.n.-monitored election campaign
he interviewed mr. o'linn head of a commission charged with investigating electoral intimidation and reported that mr. o'linn was openly sympathetic to swapo and indeed had defended its leaders in court
after mr. stanley 's article was published in two namibian newspapers mr. o'linn had criminal charges brought against their editors publisher and lawyer
mr. stanley was arrested and charged along with the others when he returned to namibia this month
both the state department and the lawyers committee for freedom of the press have protested mr. stanley 's detention
mr. stanley 's arrest is the latest in a series of incidents that threaten to derail namibia 's elections
both south african and swapo extremists are intimidating voters
the u.s. is in the habit of arranging peace settlements and then washing its hands over the tragic results
it now has the chance to redress that record in namibia
state and the human-rights community should insist that mr. stanley and his fellow defendants be released and that the united nation 's monitors make certain that mr. o'linn's commission investigates election complaints from all sides
commodity futures prices generally reflected the stability of the stock market following its plunge friday
yesterday the stock market 's influence at first created nervousness
later however it became more of an undercurrent than a dominating force as individual markets reacted more to their own factors
gold the traditional haven in times of financial crisis continued its inverse lockstep with the dollar rising early in the day as the currency fell and then giving up some of its gains as the dollar recovered
copper and crude oil reacted sharply to the concern that a crash yesterday could have a potentially devastating effect on the economy
copper fell and showed little rebound through the day as one of the major supply problems that had been supporting prices appeared to be solved
crude oil declined early but as the stock market retained early gains it too became stronger ending with a small net loss
trading in cotton and sugar was nervous and showed small declines
in chicago grain and soybean prices rose slightly
livestock and meat prices however dropped on concern that a financial crisis would cut consumption of beef and pork
in commodity markets yesterday precious metals futures prices were moderately higher as gold gave up some of its early gains and platinum behaved independently first falling and then later rising
silver performed quietly
the spot october gold price rose $ 4 to $ 367.30 an ounce
the more active december delivery gold settled with a gain of $ 3.90 an ounce at $ 371.20 after trading as high as $ 374
december silver was up 2.3 cents an ounce at $ 5.163
platinum behaved more like an industrial metal easing early on concern over a possible weaker economy but recovering later as the stock market strengthened
gold was nowhere the spectacular performer it was two years ago on black monday
for one thing last friday precious metals markets closed before the stock market went into its late-in-the-day nose dive so it could n't react to it
back on friday oct. 16 l987 the stock market declined during the day and gold prices surged as the stock market fell
the october 1987 contract that day rose as much as $ 8.70 to as high as $ 471.60 and the more deferred positions due to mature as late as march 1989 rose as much as $ 9.60
on black monday oct. 19 1987 the october contract tacked on further gains rising to as high as $ 491.50 for a gain of almost $ 20 on top of the friday advances before giving up almost $ 10 of that at the close
yesterday 's october gain of $ 4 was miniscule compared with that
one analyst peter cardillo of josephthal & co. new york said the gold market already had some good price-supporting technical factors that would have caused prices to rise with or without the stock market
what the stock market did was cause the rise to take place earlier than it would have happened said mr. cardillo
there 's a good chance that gold will retain its gains and rise further he said
he expects a drop in interest rates which would help gold by keeping the dollar from rising
finally according to mr. cardillo the impact of the strong dollar should be reflected in reduced exports in the august merchandise trade deficit when the figures are released today
this would be damaging to the dollar and supportive for gold he said
energy
worried that friday 's 190-point stock market plunge might be a harbinger of things to come for the economy petroleum futures traders called a halt to the recent string of increases in crude oil futures prices
the u.s. benchmark crude west texas intermediate closed at $ 20.59 a barrel for november delivery down 30 cents
some analysts said crude was due for a correction anyhow following several days of significant gains
but most market observers agreed that friday 's stock market drop is what dampened spirits in the petroleum pits yesterday
until yesterday futures prices had been headed up on expectations that world oil demand will continue to be strong
the organization of petroleum exporting countries increased its production ceiling for the fourth quarter based on projections of robust demand
so any bearish indicator such as friday 's precipitous drop in the stock market sends shivers through the oil markets as well
indeed after reacting early in the trading day to friday 's plummet futures prices firmed up again as traders took note of the stock market 's partial recovery yesterday
copper
futures prices fell and showed little rebound as one major labor problem that had been underpinning prices appeared to be solved
the december contract declined 3.05 cents a pound to $ 1.2745
prices were down from the outset of trading on concern that a drop in the stock market might create a weakened economy and a consequent reduction in copper use
but the recovery in the stock market provided little help for copper as word spread that a three-month strike at the highland valley mine in british columbia was about over according to an analyst
highland valley is a large canadian producer and principal supplier to japan which recently began seeking copper elsewhere as its inventories shrank
last week it was reported that company and union negotiations had overcome the major hurdle the contracting out of work by the company
now the analyst said only minor points remain to be cleaned up
for all intents and purposes an agreement appears to have been achieved he said
copper inventories in new york 's commodity exchange warehouses rose yesterday by 516 tons to 10,004 tons
london metal exchange copper inventories last week declined 13,575 tons to 89,300 tons
the lme stocks decline was about as expected but the comex gain was n't
however this was brushed aside by concern over the stock market the analyst said
at one point in futures trading as the stock market firmed the december contract rose to as high as $ 1.2965 but it was n't able to sustain the gain
it was simply overbought he said and selling by funds that are computer guided helped depress prices
cotton
futures prices eased more in reaction to hurricane jerry than to any influence of the stock market
the december contract ended with a loss of 0.22 cent a pound at 74.48 cents
technical considerations following the hurricane which was a factor in the market friday caused prices to decline yesterday said ernest simon cotton specialist for prudential-bache securities new york
prices rose sharply friday as the storm approached texas and louisiana which is part of the mississippi delta cotton-growing area
however after absorbing the potential effect of the hurricane prices began to slip late friday mr. simon said
that selling continued yesterday and kept prices under pressure he said
colder weather is being predicted for the high plains of texas and the northern states of the delta during the coming weekend mr. simon said
that has n't yet captured traders ' attention he added
sugar
futures prices declined
the march contract was off 0.32 cent a pound at 13.97 cents
at one point in early trading the march price rose to as high as 14.22 cents when the stock market recovered but the price then fell back
a price-depressing factor one analyst said was that india which had been expected to buy around 200,000 tons of sugar in the world market did n't make any purchases
india recently bought 200,000 tons and was expected to buy more the analyst said
another analyst thought that india may have pulled back because of the concern over the stock market
india may have felt that if there was a severe drop in the stock market and it affected sugar it could buy at lower prices said judith ganes analyst for shearson lehman hutton new york
at any rate she added india needs the sugar so it will be in sooner or later to buy it
farm products
the prices of cattle and hog futures contracts dropped sharply because traders speculated that the stock market plunge friday will linger in the minds of u.s. consumers long enough to prompt them to rein in their spending at the supermarket which would hurt demand for beef and pork
the price of the hog contract for october delivery dropped its maximum permissible daily limit of 1.5 cents a pound
the prices of most grain futures contracts rose slightly yesterday out of relief that the stock market was showing signs of recovering
earlier in the session the prices of several soybean contracts set new lows
a broad rally began when several major processors began buying futures contracts apparently to take advantage of the price dip
knight-ridder inc. said it would report increased earnings per share for the third quarter contrary to reported analysts ' comments that the publishing company 's earnings would be down
a company spokesman said he believed the confusion was caused when james batten knight-ridder 's chairman and chief executive told new york analysts two weeks ago that knight-ridder 's earnings per share for the first nine months of 1989 would be behind a little bit from like period of
the knight-ridder spokesman said the third-quarter earnings that the company plans to report oct. 24 are expected to be up
the spokesman said he was comfortable with revised analysts ' projections that the company would report earnings of between 62 cents and 64 cents a share compared with the 53 cents a share it reported for the 1988 third quarter
knight-ridder said it agreed with estimates that net income for all of 1989 would be around $ 2.86 a share compared with $ 2.59 a share a year earlier

the company earned $ 36 million or 57 cents a share in the year-ago quarter
herbert m. sandler chairman and chief executive officer of the oakland calif. savings-and-loan holding company credited the high number of loans added to the company 's portfolio over the last 12 months for broadening its earning asset base and improving profit performance
however the executive noted that slackening demand for new mortgages depressed new loan originations to $ 1 billion 30 % below the same period last year
in savings activity mr. sandler said consumer deposits have enjoyed a steady increase throughout 1989 and topped $ 11 billion at quarter 's end for the first time in the company 's history
deposit growth amounted to $ 393 million more than double the year-ago figure
whirlpool corp. benton harbor mich. said it has developed a process to recover environmentally harmful chlorofluorocarbons or cfcs that previously entered the atmosphere during in-home repair of refrigerators and freezers
the maker of home appliances said the process which involves the use of a multilayer plastic bag during repairs to capture the gaseous substance and transport it to a recycling center is already in use at a number of its service centers and will be available to all authorized repair centers by spring
earlier repairs vented the cfcs out of the home through a hose directly into the atmosphere
cfcs are widely used as solvents coolants and fire suppressants
but their use has been linked to a potentially dangerous depletion of the earth 's ozone layer and a number of companies are seeking to curtail use or at least emission of the substance
whirpool said we see this process as a small but important step toward eventual elimination of cfc use in appliance manufacture
maxus energy corp. dallas said it discovered a new oil field northeast of its previously discovered intan field in the southeast sumatra area of indonesia
maxus said it did n't run a production test on the three discovery wells it drilled in the field which is about 1.6 miles from the intan field because the wells are similar to others drilled at its intan and widuri fields
however maxus said it believes the reserves in the field are about 10 million barrels of oil
the intan field has estimated reserves of 50 million barrels and the widuri field has estimated reserves of 225 million barrels
maxus an independent oil and gas concern is the operator and owns a 56 % interest in the new field called northeast intan

net for the third quarter restated is $ 1.6 million or 10 cents a share
the company previously reported net of $ 2.3 million or 15 cents a share

the dow jones industrial average jumped sharply yesterday to close at 2657.38 panic did n't sweep the world 's markets and investors large and small seemed to accept friday 's dizzying 190-point plunge as a sharp correction not a calamity
many went bargain-hunting
among those sighing with relief was john h. gutfreund chairman of salomon brothers who took to the firm 's trading floor to monitor yesterday 's events
as the rally gained strength at 3:15 p.m. he smiled broadly brandished his unlit cigar and slapped stanley shopkorn his top stock trader on the back
at first it seemed as if history might repeat itself
as trading opened yesterday morning on the big board stocks of many of the nation 's biggest companies could n't open for trading because a wave of sell orders was overwhelming buyers
by 10:10 the dow industrials were off 63.52 points and the stock of ual corp. whose troubles had kicked off friday 's plunge still had n't opened
but then as quickly as the dow had fallen it began to turn around
it ended with a gain of 88.12 points
by the market 's close volume on the new york exchange totaled more than 416 million the fourth highest on record
the big board handled the huge volume without any obvious strain in sharp contrast to black monday of 1987
but the rally was largely confined to the blue-chip stocks which had been hard hit during friday 's selling frenzy
overall more big board stocks lost money than gained
and many arbitragers already reeling from friday 's collapse of the ual deal were further hurt yesterday when a proposed takeover of amr corp. the parent of american airlines collapsed
indeed the dow jones transportation average plunged 102.06 points its second-worst drop in history
world-wide trading was generally manageable
the frankfurt stock exchange was hardest hit of the major markets with blue chips there falling 12.8 %
in london a midday rally left the market 's major index off 3.2 % and tokyo 's leading stock index fell only 1.8 % in surprisingly lackluster trading
other more thinly traded asian markets were hit harder than tokyo 's but there were no free-fall declines
investors big and small say they learned valuable lessons since the 1987 crash in this age of computerized trading huge corrections or runups in a few hours ' time must be expected
what 's more such short-term cataclysms are survivable and are no cause for panic selling
stephen boesel a major money manager for t. rowe price in baltimore says there was less panic than in 1987 we had been through it once
in somerset wis. adrian sween who owns a supplier of nursing-home equipment and is n't active in the stock market agrees
i look at it as a ho-hum matter he says
many other factors played a part in yesterday 's comeback
the federal reserve signaled its willingness to provide liquidity the interest rate on its loans to major banks inched downward early in the day
foreign stock markets which kicked off black monday with a huge selling spree began the day off by relatively modest amounts
the dollar after falling sharply in overnight trading to 139.10 yen bounced back strongly to 141.8 thus easing fears that foreigners would unload u.s. stocks
and the widely disseminated opinion among most market experts that a crash was n't in store also helped calm investors
many major institutions for example came into work yesterday ready to buy some of the blue chips they felt had been sharply undervalued on friday
still amid all the backslapping and signs of relief over yesterday 's events some market professionals cautioned that there is nothing present in the current market system to prevent another dizzying drop such as friday 's
there is too much complacency says money manager barry schrager
computers have increasingly connected securities markets world-wide so that a buying or selling wave in one market is often passed around the globe
so investors everywhere nervously eyed yesterday 's opening in tokyo where the nikkei average of 225 blue-chip stocks got off to a rocky start
the average plunged some 600 points or 1.7 % in the first 20 minutes of trading
but the selling wave had no conviction and the market first surged upward by 200 points then drifted lower closing down 647
unlike two years ago most of japan 's major investors chose to sit this calamity out
in merrill lynch & co. 's tokyo trading room some 40 traders and assistants sat quietly with few orders to process
clients are all staying out of the market one merrill trader says
the relative calm in tokyo proved little comfort to markets opening up in europe
frankfurt 's opening was delayed a half hour because of a crush of sell orders
the beginning was chaotic says nigel longley a broker for commerzbank
in london the view from the trading floor of an american securities firm jefferies & co. also was troubling
a computer screen displaying 100 blue-chip stocks colors each one red when its price is falling
the screen was a sea of red
i see concern but i do n't see panic says j. francis palamara a new yorker who runs the 15-trader office
london 's blue-chip stock index turned up just before 8 a.m. new york time sending an encouraging message to wall street
when trading opened in new york at 9:30 a.m. edt stocks fell sharply as expected
futures markets in chicago had opened at a level suggesting the dow would fall by about 60 points
with sell orders piled up from friday about half the stocks in the dow could n't open on time
by 9:45 the industrial average had dropped 27 points
by 10 a.m. it was down 49
ten minutes later the dow hit bottom down 63.52 points another 2.5 %
but shortly before then some of wall street 's sharpest traders say they sensed a turn
the first thing that caught my eye that was encouraging was treasury bonds were off says austin george head of stock trading at t. rowe price
it meant that people were n't running pell-mell to the safety of bonds
shortly after 10 a.m. the major market index a chicago board of trade futures contract of 20 stocks designed to mimic the djia exploded upward
stock traders were buoyed because an upturn in the mmi had also started the recovery in stocks on the tuesday following black monday
the mmi has gone better shouted a trader in the london office of shearson lehman hutton
shearson 's london trading room went wild
traders shouted out as their reuters quotron and telerate screens posted an ever-narrowing loss on wall street
then nine minutes later wall street suddenly rebounded to a gain on the day
rally rally rally shouted shearson 's andy rosen
this is panic buying
major blue-chip stocks like philip morris general motors and proctor & gamble led the rally
japanese were said to be heavy buyers
german and dutch investors reportedly loaded up on kellogg co
then traders say corporations with share buy-back programs kicked into high gear triggering gains in among other issues alcan aluminium and mcdonald 's
walt disney co. which had one of the biggest sell-order imbalances on friday and was one of seven stocks that halted trading and never reopened that day opened yesterday late at 114.5 down 8.5
but then it suddenly burst upward 7.5 as goldman sachs & co. stepped in and bought almost every share offer traders said
by 10:25 the dow had turned up for the day prompting cheers on trading desks and exchange floors
among big board specialists the cry was pull your offers meaning that specialists soon expected to get higher prices for their shares
it was bedlam on the upside said one big board specialist
what we had was a real old-fashioned rally
this technical strength spurred buying from wall street 's black boxes computer programs designed to trigger large stock purchases during bullish periods
typical perhaps was batterymarch 's dean lebaron
mr. lebaron who manages $ 10 billion says we turned the trading system on and it did whatever it was programmed to do
asked what stocks the computer bought the money manager says i do n't know
not everybody was making money
the carnage on the chicago board options exchange the nation 's major options market was heavy after the trading in s&p 100 stock-index options was halted friday
many market makers in the s&p 100 index options contract had bullish positions friday and when the shutdown came they were frozen with huge losses
over the weekend clearing firms told the chicago market makers to get out of their positions at any cost monday morning

chicago investor william farley agreed to sell three divisions of cluett peabody & co. for about $ 600 million to bidermann s.a. a closely held clothing maker based in paris
shortly after completing the $ 1.56 billion acquisition of west point-pepperell inc. in april mr. farley 's holding company farley inc. said it was considering the sale of cluett a leading shirt maker and one of west point-pepperell 's biggest units
included in the sale are cluett units that make men 's shirts under the arrow name socks under the gold toe name and menswear through the schoeneman division
the companies said the agreement is subject to bidermann 's receipt of financing and to regulatory and other approvals
they said the sale is expected to be concluded by the end of november
mr. farley said the sale of three of cluett 's four main divisions plus other anticipated west point-pepperell asset sales by december should bring in a total of about $ 700 million
he did n't elaborate on other asset sales being considered
mr. farley followed a similar pattern when he acquired northwest industries inc. and then sold much of its assets
but he kept fruit of the loom inc. the underwear maker that he still controls and serves as chairman and chief executive
cluett was an independent company until west point-pepperell acquired it for $ 375 million in cash and stock in 1986
in the fiscal year ended sept. 30 1988 cluett had operating profit of $ 37 million on sales of $ 757 million

britain 's blue arrow plc intends to change its name to manpower plc and write off a chunk of the nearly $ 1.2 billion in good will realized in the takeover of u.s.-based manpower inc
blue arrow chairman mitchell fromstein said in an interview that the two steps may be a prelude to reincorporating the world 's biggest employment-services group in the u.s
mr. fromstein disclosed the planned steps expected within a few months as blue arrow posted a 2.5 % drop in its third-quarter pretax earnings
the name change and good will write-off could help solidify blue arrow 's dominance of the u.s. temporary-help market and give it a more american image as u.s. investors turn jittery about foreign stocks after friday 's market plunge
u.s. holders now own more than 60 % of blue arrow compared with 9 % last january
in the u.s. market the recognition of the manpower name is infinitely stronger than blue arrow mr. fromstein said
the moves also could erase shareholders ' perception of blue arrow as a company in turmoil
it further reinforces the concept that blue arrow is a thing of the past said doug arthur an analyst at kidder peabody & co. in new york
the proposed changes all make a lot of sense to me he added
in a widely publicized boardroom coup mr. fromstein ousted antony berry as blue arrow chief executive in january a month after mr. berry had forced mr. fromstein out as the $ 1 million-a-year chief of milwaukee-based manpower
mr. fromstein solidified his control in april by taking over from mr. berry as chairman
but the blue arrow tumult is n't over yet as the british government is investigating a disputed # 25 million $ 39.4 million loan which mr. fromstein has said was made under mr. berry 's direction
blue arrow was able to pull off the $ 1.34 billion takeover of manpower in 1987 largely because different british and american accounting standards produce higher reported earnings for british companies
under british rules blue arrow was able to write off at once the $ 1.15 billion in good will arising from the purchase
as a u.s.-based company blue arrow would have to amortize the good will over as many as 40 years creating a continuing drag on reported earnings
good will is the excess of cost of an acquired firm operating unit or assets over the current or fair market value of those assets
but with so many shares now held in the u.s. blue arrow reports its earnings two ways based on both u.k. and u.s. accounting standards
our balance sheets look like they came from alice 's wonderland mr. fromstein said
the british version shows a handful of pounds of net worth following the 1987 write-off of good will while the american version reflects $ 1 billion of net worth because almost none of the good will has been written off
mr. fromstein said he hopes to eradicate some of the good will left on blue arrow 's u.s. books in one fell swoop but would n't specify how much
people close to blue arrow suggested the write-down would represent a sizable chunk with executives claiming prior management overstated the extent of manpower 's good will
that move along with the return to the manpower name could bolster the company 's prospects during possibly difficult times for temporary help
the number of u.s. temporary workers fell about 1 % in the 12 months ending aug. 31 after sliding nearly 3.5 % in july said kidder peabody 's mr. arthur
blue arrow blamed the pretax profit drop in the quarter ended july 31 partly on slower earnings growth of non-manpower units in britain
overall pretax profit slid to # 18.49 million in the quarter from # 18.98 million a year earlier
richard g. sim the man credited with transforming applied power inc. from an underachiever into a feisty player in the global market for hydraulic tools hopes to guide a similar turnaround at the company 's latest acquisition barry wright corp
the 45-year-old former general electric co. executive figures it will be easier this time
but analysts while applauding the acquisition say applied 's chief executive faces a tough challenge in integrating the two companies
barry wright acquired by applied for $ 147 million makes computer-room equipment and vibration-control systems
the watertown mass. company 's sales have been dormant and its profits have dropped
last year 's earnings of $ 1.3 million including $ 815,000 from a restructuring gain were far below the year-earlier $ 8.4 million
besides spurring barry wright 's sales which were $ 201.7 million in 1988 mr. sim must pare its costs and product line
the question is how long it 's going to take barry wright to make a contribution says f. john mirek an analyst at blunt ellis loewi in milwaukee
the answer will help determine whether applied continues to reach the ambitious goals set by mr. sim
the butler wis. manufacturer went public at $ 15.75 a share in august 1987 and mr. sim 's goal then was a $ 29 per-share price by 1992
strong earnings growth helped achieve that price far ahead of schedule in august 1988
the stock has since softened trading around $ 25 a share last week and closing yesterday at $ 23.00 in national over-the-counter trading
but mr. sim has set a fresh target of $ 50 a share by the end of
reaching that goal says robert t. foote applied 's chief financial officer will require efficient reinvestment of cash by applied and continuation of its healthy 19 % rate of return on operating capital
in barry wright mr. sim sees a situation very similar to the one he faced when he joined applied as president and chief operating officer in 1985
applied then a closely held company was stagnating under the management of its controlling family
while profitable it was n't growing and was n't providing a satisfactory return on invested capital he says
mr. sim is confident that the drive to dominate certain niche markets will work at barry wright as it has at applied
he also professes an evangelical fervor to develop a corporate culture that rewards managers who produce and where decision-making is shared
mr. sim considers the new unit 's operations fundamentally sound and adds that barry wright has been fairly successful in moving into markets that have n't interested larger competitors
with a little patience these businesses will perform very satisfactorily mr. sim says
within about six months things will be moving in the right direction he predicts
mr. sim figures it will be easier to turn barry wright around since he 's now in the driver 's seat
when he came to applied i did n't have the power to execute as i do today he says
he was named chief executive officer of applied in 1986 and became chairman last november
at applied mr. sim set growth as his first objective
he took the company public in an offering that netted applied about $ 12.6 million which helped launch the company 's acquisition program
sales climbed to an estimated $ 245 million in fiscal 1989 ended aug. 31 from $ 99.9 million in fiscal 1985
the company expects that earnings which have marched steadily upward in recent years reached about $ 20.8 million or $ 1.58 a share in the fiscal year just ended up from $ 15.2 million in fiscal 1988 and $ 3.9 million in 1985
